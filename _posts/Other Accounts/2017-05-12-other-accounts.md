Wen-wen is really very talented, and are doing hard in practising the game. I think your progess can be concluded with “the heaven reward those who work hard”, since he likes it and are willing to practise more. In fact, we often play it in other time, and he can often blind me. Very great. ![doge](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/b6/doge_org.gif)

Many friends PMed me about who progressed the most in this episode, here's my responsible answer: ZHAN Yi-wen! [@YiAnMusicClub-ZhanYiWen](http://weibo.com/u/6108090526) He's completely invested in the game. It doesn't matter if standed at the wrong side, because this is what the game of *Werewolf* is – no right or wrong, no scapegoat; after being deceived many times, one will certainly be more cautious – this is the process of growth, this is what the boys should experience, this is the original intention of the show. It is to play, it is to learn! Very pleased. :blush::blush:
