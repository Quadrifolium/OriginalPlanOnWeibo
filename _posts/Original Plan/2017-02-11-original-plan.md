[#TransdimensionalIdol](http://weibo.com/p/100808fab985aab0bfb2724bf4d29856cf6ee7) Member of the first session of “Plan R” and of the Music Club of Yi An – [@YiAnMusicClub-ZhanYiWen](http://weibo.com/u/6108090526) published. There are already two characters in glasses. Differ from the others, these two members switch the image with and without glasses freely. But about which image to show, they have it on their own~ But I think they don't wear glasses when dancing – it'd be broken. ![Husky](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/74/moren_hashiqi_org.png)

Yi An Middle School  
ZHAN Yi-wen (Top student in Class 2, Junior Grade 1)  
Aloof and detached, always keep a distance away from others, but is extremely longing for friendship in the heart. Perfect student in teachers' eyes, but is actually brisk in mind – full of scheming and resourceful ideas.
