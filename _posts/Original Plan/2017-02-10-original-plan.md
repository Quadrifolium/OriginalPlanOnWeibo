Yi An is a school featured in football, therefore it's nothing strange for a young National Level-1 football player and the member of the Football Team join the Music Club. But difference in profession makes huge gaps, will [@YiAnMusicClub](http://weibo.com/u/6094546964) take him in? Find out the answer from 14th Feb.!

Yi An Middle School  
CHI Yi (Student in Class 2, Junior Grade 1)  
Well-behaved, a merit student good in both study and sports. Courteous to everyone, seems introverted. Timid but can always hold out till the end.
