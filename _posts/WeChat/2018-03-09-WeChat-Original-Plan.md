**Sidelights during the Festival**

1. “Morning call is a laborious job”  
As students in Junior Sector, ZHAN Yi-wen and CHI Yi “enjoy” the morning call service from the staff. One day, ZHAN Yi-wen returned to his own house. Then CHI Yi said to the staff earnestly: “It seems you only have to strive with me in the next morning.” ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
2. “An artistic photo”  
One day, LIN Mo in reading called a staff to come.  
Staff: What's up?  
Lin: Look. What a nice photo. Can you tell what it is expressing?  
Staff: … No.  
Lin: It is conveying the message of “I am nice to you but you are dragging my underpants”. Look, he grabbed it.  
Staff: …  
All right. It is an artistic photo.
3. “雕” (diāo; vulture; eagle) and “貂” (diāo; marten; ermine; sable)  
One day, the boys were talking about peculiar pets.  
Chi: There's a pet called “diāo” (marten). It's very cute.  
He: Ah~ I know! Many people are keeping it as a pet, and should wear gloves. It can fly out to catch a hare and fly back.  
Chi: … Not that one. 🙄️ This “diāo” (marten) also has its *máo* (毛; fur) used for coat …  
He: Yes. I mean the same “diāo” (vulture).  
Chi: 🙄️ If a “diāo” (vulture) has a “diāo”(marten)'s *máo* (fur), how can it fly…  
He: Isn't a “diāo” (vulture) having “diāo”(vulture)'s *máo* (毛; feather)?
