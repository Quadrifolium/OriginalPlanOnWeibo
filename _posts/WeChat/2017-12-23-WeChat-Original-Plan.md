**Sidelights**

*Jottings during Huajiao Live Fest*

Date: 18th December
Place: Some hotel in Beijing
Personae: HE Luo-luo, LIN Mo, FANG Xiang-rui, CHI Yi

No. 1:
The guys went to the restaurant for breakfast, but had not much food due to the poor appetite. Later, a staff told them: the event today may last very long, the time for lunch would be delayed to unknown time, I think … It's not finished yet, but with a bang on the door, the guys rushed back to the restaurant and brought many food back. (￢_￢) Mm, now you learnt to plan ahead. (～￣▽￣)～

No. 2:
The first batch arrived at Beijing made a birthday surprise for LIN Mo. They prepared a birthday cake with Santa Claus. But the Santa Claus got to LIN Mo's mouth quickly. He found it's not the time, and wickedly instigated CHI Yi to taste it. A staff was to mention that's decoration, not fondant, and found he's putting the Santa Claus back, pretended to be ignorant and asked “why's there a row of tooth print on the Santa Claus”.

No. 3:
FANG Xiang-rui was shuttling by plane for days, got to the hotel until 2 o'clock in the morning. When came at half past ten for fitting costumes, the dresser found he's wearing a set of very thick underclothes. Facing awkward but polite smiles from the others, Fang-fang take off the thick clothes in silence. A staff intended to take the clothes away, Fang-fang said in nervous at once: “Do please take good care of the clothes!” Why did Fang-fang pay so much attention to such a set of plain clothes? He explained solemnly: “They are what the filming team issued. I should give back in the end. Don't cast them away!” All right. Mm. This can be taken as “taking care of public property”. (；¬＿¬)

No. 4:
“Bracket-style hair” is in vogue among boys. That is to have bangs in symmetric C-shape. The leader HE Luo-luo would like to have a try, and spent two hours for it in the wash room. But gave up and came out with his wet hair. ヽ(´¬`)ノ

No. 5:
After the live of the Charity Evening, they returned to the hotel. The elevator only works after swiping the room card and press a button. The accommodating LIN Mo said “leave it to me”, and plugged his card in a slot. The others knew he had done it, and didn't pay attention. It was a long time, but they were still staying in the first floor … A foreigner in the elevator can't wait any more, took out his card and pressed the button, then said with Mandarin: “It's to swipe the card.”
