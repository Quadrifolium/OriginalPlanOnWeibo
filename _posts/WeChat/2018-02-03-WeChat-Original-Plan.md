**Sidelights**

1. Titbits in the training room  
(1) One day, when getting training on flexibility, all the other boys were screeching seriously when doing the splits except XIA Tian-yi, who can do the perfect split easily. Thus the flexible XIA Tian-yi got a nickname “Monster” in the training room.  
(2) One day, the teacher taught them a skill of rolling on the ground. Baby CHI Yi mastered it in seconds, while the others were not. Then, the proud CHI Yi stunned everyone – he rolled a dozen of times in one minute.
2. Not that “Paper Plane”  
One day, the teacher recommend Sandy Lam(林憶蓮)'s *Paper Plane*<sup>[1]</sup> to Luo-luo.  
Teacher: “Luo-luo, listen to *Paper Plane* and learn it, I want to listen to yours when the class's over.”  
Then, Luo-luo was preparing for the whole morning. When the class was getting to the end, Luo-luo met a staff and asked in confusion: “Why did the teacher choose such a strange song?”  
And the staff took a look, and laughed. It turned out that he was listening to a song with the same title sung by an Internet singer. (Yes, in that beat style) ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
3. The follow-up of Tik Tok thing  
Since the others got brainwashed by the Tik Tok tunes from CHI Yi, there came a patient who went critical. That's right, it's SUN Yi-hang with sensitive music sense.  
So now the problem is – when a person with sensitive music sense was infected, will the diffusion become faster?

Note:
1. Paper Plane (纸飞机), Sandy Lam(林憶蓮), Truly...Sandy Lam (原來…林憶蓮), 2001.
