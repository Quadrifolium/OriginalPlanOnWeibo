**Selfies which don't like to be blamed on the sharpness**

**Tidbits**

*One*  
LIN Mo the photographer, proved himself with the actual ability

Several days ago, LIN Mo went back to the dorm excitedly, and told the others that he learnt a new ultimate skill of photographing! Mm … That is the skill of “flash + inverse/bright colour” which goes viral on Tik Tok. And Mo started to get busy about using the skill to take fashionable photos for them. However, all of them refused with disdain.  
Finally, with Mo's stick and carrot, FANG Xiang-rui agreed to “take the risk”, and became the model of LIN Mo the photographer~  
After a period of time, Mo showed the finished photos to the others in a casual way. And the result is …  
Amazing!!!  
Indeed, amazing!  
The cold or antique hue mixed with the film texture, it is really fashionable! Then, Luo-luo, Hang, Wen, and CHI Yi began to ask Lin the photographer to take them as models.  
In the end, Lin the photographer proved himself with the actual ability, and told us a profound law:  
Don't refuse too early, or you might be regretful.

*Two*  
Happy birthday to no one

Background: In every month, Original Plan will choose one day to celebrate the birthdays for the staff born in the month. And this affair happened in such celebration in March.  
After a lesson, the boys heard the birthday song coming out from the office. So they rushed there and wanted to join the celebration. They expressed the sincerest blessings to the staff with repetition of the song.  
After looking around, Hang asked the staff near him: “Who's birthday is it?”  
Staff: I've no idea.  
Then, the crowd started the quiz of “who's birthday is it”. Minutes later, they found out that it's no one's birthday on that day, though they had gathered together and sung the birthday song for many times~  
But it didn't matter. No one claimed, but blessings remain, and the joy was surrounding.
