**Tidbits**

1. Recharge the traffic  
One day, Fang-fang, CHI Yi, Luo-luo, and Hang were talking about genres of entertainers.  
Luo: I want to be an icon with competitive strength, and of course with traffic of attention.<sup>[1]</sup>  
Fang & Hang: (Nodding with deep agreement)  
Chi: (In doubt) It's sure the traffic is essential, and it's easy to recharge it<sup>[2]</sup> …
2. “That's not evolved completely …”  
One day in the dressing room:  
The dresser was fitting LIN Mo, but every suit with fit body has short sleeves. So the staff concluded that LIN Mo has long arms.  
Chi: That's not having long arms, but not evolved completely!  
Mm … Sneering brothers, period. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Note:
1. The traffic of attention refers to the extent of exposure of an entertainer in show biz.
2. To recharge the (data) traffic means to pay for extra mobile data service.
