**Sidelights during the Festival**

1. “Luckiest Baby CHI Yi”  
The most exciting moment during the New Year festival is to vie for red envelopes in family groups, working groups, and classmate groups~ In this year, a handsome and kind staff dispensed red envelopes in the group. In two rounds of intense competition, Baby CHI Yi got 0.71 yuan and 0.32 yuan<sup>[1]</sup> beyond (very) doubt (surprisingly)~ Perhaps he could consider buying lotteries.
2. “That Fang, what makes you misunderstand the word ‘handsome’?”  
One day, that some handsome and kind staff was asking the boys for selfies, in order to provide materials for editor.  
With the requirement: handsome and highly charming.  
Seconds later, that Fang sent one with sleepy eyes and body in quilt, which caused great sneer … The other boys criticised at once:  
Luo: Who's that?  
Yi: Why's someone who don't know popping out in this group?  
Mo: Excuse me, what makes you misunderstand the word “handsome”?  
Wen: I have to clean my eyes …  
Hang: So there are many things we don't know.  
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Note:
1. Red envelopes dispensed via WeChat are often in very small and random value.
