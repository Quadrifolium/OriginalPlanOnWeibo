**Sidelights**

1. From Oliver to Andy  
The childe in vogue ZHAN Yi-wen has a very fashionable English name – Oliver. One day, Childe Zhan gave himself another smarter and more complicated name – Huttadis. Out of the favour of it, he started to promote the new name to everyone he met. But it's too hard for the others to remember it …  
One day, Childe Zhan asked a staff: “What's my new English name?”  
An answer in inadvertence: “Andy?”  
Others: “Oh~ So ZHAN Yi-wen's new name is Andy.”  
The childe got into a temper, and refused to accept it. However, the others were having special preference to the name “Andy”, and had taken it as the truth. After that, everyone would call him Andy, while Childe Zhan never replies in loftiness.  
After a long time, when some staff spoke to Childe Zhan: “Andy~ We'll leave for meal. Bye-bye~”  
Zhan: “OK. Bye-bye.” ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
2. The power of brainwashing tunes  
Recently, baby CHI Yi was infatuated with Tik Tok<sup>[1]</sup>, and was deemed as countrified. But CHI Yi cared nothing for this, still kept on humming the brainwashing tunes in it in the leisure tme, day after day, without a stop.  
And then, whatever the staff or the boys were humming, that's a tune in Tik Tok …
3. English dab with peculiar grammar  
One day,  
LIN Mo: “What time is it now?”  
A staff: “5:55. Sorry that I can't speak in English.”  
LIN Mo: “Oh. Five five five~”  
Mm … Knowledge acquired ↑↑↑

Note:
1. Tik Tok (抖音) is a mobile app on short video sharing.
