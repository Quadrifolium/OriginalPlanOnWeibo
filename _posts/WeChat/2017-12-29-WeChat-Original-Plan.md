**To You**

In the last weekend, the first signing session was held in Shanghai. We spent 4 hours, 240 minutes, 14,400 seconds together. The boys in Yi An was nervous and reserved at first, but became composed and assured later, and got sore hands in the end. But this is the first time they signed their own names so many times.
We thank everyone of you coming for the session, you delivered confidence to the boys. They will keep learning and growing from every activity.
Time cannot drain resistence, transformation resists time. The boys keep the expectation and appreciation in the heart, try hard to be the best selves, and show achievements on stage. The spotlight focuses on the dream worthy of anticipation, the boys in Yi An will always do solid work to give out brighter light. See you next year!

**Sidelights**

1. “The secret no one knew”  
I think everyone knows that Baby CHI Yi likes eating snacks. One day, his mother sent him a box of snacks. Overjoyed CHI Yi hid them carefully under his bed, as fast as lightning, to keep them away from some other envious people. After a series of challenging movements, CHI Yi was very satisfied, and thought no one else except himself and the snacks would know this secret. However … On the next day after the training, when CHI Yi got back to him room and pulling the box from under the bed, all the others members appeared by the door, and “the secret no one knew” became “the secret everyone knows” … Looking at the empty box, Baby CHI Yi began to sing: “Ah~ What a painful taste~”<sup>[1]</sup> Mm, so grieved, so touching …
2. *Mantou* redressing  
If you watched the *Jottings* released this Monday, you must be impressed by Fang's position that he eats *Mantou* every day. Many viewers thumb up for the choice. But *Mantou* won't be glad, since the truth is: As a southerner, Fang seldom ate *Mantou* before, only when he tasted it recently did he have it for several days! Just days after his position, Fang had enough of it, and was doubting: “Why's *Mantou* not tasty like it was days before?” Don't blame *Mantou*, it's not its fault …

Note:
1. The lyrics of a song.
2. *Mantou* (馒头), Chinese steamed bun.
