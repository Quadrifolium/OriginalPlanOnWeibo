**Sidelights**

1. “Interesting” gashapon  
One day after school time, LIN Mo came back with two gashapon, and was introducing to every others: “Look, the gashapon's joint is movable. The head can rotate on and on.” And was also demonstrating the “unique skill”.  
Facing the unremarkable response from others, LIN Mo didn't get discouraged, but went on with his promotion: “Don't you look down. It has other functions! You can hang it on your mobile, bag, or whatever you want. Awesome?” Then, he would stare at opposite side with expecting eyes, and only let it go after the person admits that the gashapon is indeed “interesting and magical”.  
(PS: Here, “let it go” doesn't mean the end of his promotion, but the turning to the next target. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯)
2. All staff are potatoes  
After supper, Alumnus Huang was chatting with the guys. When it turned to the lessons these days, the boys expressed the hope of having more professional lessons in the coming winter vacation.  
Alumnus Huang: I'm always mining<sup>[1]</sup> teachers to teach you.  
LIN Mo: Mm, it seems you take a hoe with you every day.  
CHI Yi: No. It seems all the staff are potatoes he digged out. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
3. Persistent practice of talking in sleep  
One day, when I asked about funny things about FANG Xiang-rui from the manager –  
I: Anything funny about Fang in these days?  
Manager: Does talking in sleep count?  
I: How can it be funny? What did he say?  
Manager: He's mumbling every night without an end. I don't know what he's talking about. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Note:
1. “挖” has the meaning of “dig”, “mine”, “excavate”.
