I believe you still remember the strikes from the official Weibo account on the last Thursday. They were like this:

That's right. They are the guys in Yi An. They became like those figures because –

**We are producing a new variety show – *Go on Strike! Painters!***

What is the show like? It's hard to describe. But you could watch the trailer to feel it.

<iframe class="video_iframe" data-vidtype="2" allowfullscreen="" data-ratio="1.7647058823529411" data-w="480" data-src="https://v.qq.com/iframe/player.html?vid=x0512d7zqso&amp;width=634&amp;height=356.625&amp;auto=0" style="display: block; width: 634px !important; height: 356.625px !important; overflow: hidden;" data-vh="356.625" data-vw="634" src="https://v.qq.com/iframe/player.html?vid=x0512d7zqso&amp;width=634&amp;height=356.625&amp;auto=0" scrolling="no" width="634" height="356.625" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Now how do you feel? Anyway, I was quite thrilled.

It seems the boys are going to show something big.

What exactly is the variety show *Go on Strike! Painters!* like? How do the boys become like those figures? In the afternoon of this Saturday (it's said to be 3 o'clock, but don't blame me if it's not), please watch on Bilibili.

As to the exact time – it all depends.
