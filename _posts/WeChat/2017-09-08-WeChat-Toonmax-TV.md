ZHAN Yi-wen is taking a close-up view of a gramophone record on a huge phonograph. Summoned by his bro CHI Yi, he starts to rock~ Yo~

Following the theme song, LIN Mo plugs in the magic notebook, and starts to dance with SUN Yi-hang.

HE Luo-luo is sitting in a boat of pencil case and immersed in a book, while FANG Xiang-rui is observing afar with a telescope. They are going to set sail for the journey to nowhere.

To be frank, when the brothers was filming the promo videos, I have visited the studio! I would never miss such a precious chance~ Heiheihei~

When I got to the studio, SUN Yi-hang and LIN Mo were ready for the shooting! The pale blue suit and white trousers were sending forth the vigour. The charming looks and long legs were feasting the eyes! They are just like two figures coming from a manga!

![Image](http://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_gif/EXrxYhl6d1cEIxzibLqWuTcwGeLcQw8H0e6FUQKATB1xHaTkCNm70T1NI0fLnhvojRvGUfLgjcDjX9zIhvNibeiaQ/0)

As a senior fan, I strongly recommend them to you~

![Image](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_jpg/EXrxYhl6d1f2YNrCDJI3XROHtIW0hKBG1fQpo1ZrFcXBYgYhqNPRWaXfWiaD79nicY7mxPibTRx5ZRKWrVxlR6A8g/640)

LIN Mo may be called an all-round person in Yi An Music Club. Skilled in programme presenting, singing, and dancing, full of affinity in the round spectacles, and well-received among the fans.

![Image](http://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_jpg/EXrxYhl6d1cEIxzibLqWuTcwGeLcQw8H0CXOJN5YIJ5E7cWGlHfkFsmgFia3B9amrVqLXdQVASicDVCkrfHgO2qZw/640)

SUN Yi-hang is also a somebody who has danced for many years, is no doubt the top dancer in the Music Club.

He may seems mighty on stage, but is like the cute boy next door in the other time.

Please listen to the anthem song of Yi An Music Club:  
[▷ Chitty Bang Bang Bang](https://res.wx.qq.com/voice/getvoice?mediaid=MjM5MDA0ODQ0MV8yNjU3MjU5MzE5)

With the voice in the song, the filming started!

*Words in image:* Time to dance, make some noise

I'm not fooling you. Their dance's cool, right?

![Image](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_jpg/EXrxYhl6d1cEIxzibLqWuTcwGeLcQw8H0UPPuVBJkqgp3NFJk4AI7CDblY3Vca6mQ4rmzrRTC5gwiaaot19OUHJg/640)  
*Words in image:* Blushed

I want to learn the dance! Could you teach me?

![Image](http://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_jpg/EXrxYhl6d1cEIxzibLqWuTcwGeLcQw8H0oA8xXeDuOGu1secVe3WbefIZRx1V6wRhx0BP3vpRM4Yhs9sGSx0pvw/640)

After “crack, crack,” the sound of the shutter, a nice photo was out~

During the break, the director was conducting the staff on the scenery change. Seeing the staff moving the props with sweat and testing the effect over and over, only for showing the best frames for the viewers of Toonmax, I must thumb up for all of them!

When everything's ready, CHI Yi and ZHAN Yi-wen got on stage!

![Image](http://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_gif/EXrxYhl6d1cEIxzibLqWuTcwGeLcQw8H0GHhstYuFv0gCCHgrsPJWIDJqsialMyTpEP5MkuxMf4Bgk9D2QloeH8Q/0)

If you take LIN Mo and SUN Yi-hang as handsome, these two boys are definitely the cutest in the Music Club. My heart was melting! But they are not just cute~ CHI Yi is a National Level-1 football player. Just this achievement is enough to boast~

![Image](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_jpg/EXrxYhl6d1f2YNrCDJI3XROHtIW0hKBGtNKffHibkl4TxTwR3g5ru7LxebE3x2DS3iaNQKh87JHU9gkcibf6sgoZA/640)

Warning: Attraction ahead!

*Words in image:* Nothing can stop me from playing football

Live report from the match: CHI Yi takes the field valiantly! Wow! He kicked the football into the goal! The rival's defeated! Game over …

![Image](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_jpg/EXrxYhl6d1cEIxzibLqWuTcwGeLcQw8H0X9ybhkI5oP3kiaSJIKS0FRh27H6D3f0WKf8wicgnSgff0fgxuEElDNCw/640)  
*Words in image:* You did a good job, huh?

But the quick-witted ZHAN Yi-wen is not inferior at all!

![Image](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_jpg/EXrxYhl6d1f2YNrCDJI3XROHtIW0hKBGmFGZWaq0ZkHKpACM6yibjYDWJZaDQP61Yr0b6JWa5fr5htD4hFoBc5w/640)

The brain-racking game of Werewolf is nothing difficult. His train of thought is always meticulous and calm (and confusing the rivals).

![Image](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_jpg/EXrxYhl6d1cEIxzibLqWuTcwGeLcQw8H0ddK4K4FjBbXwIEgTKWpVHpyYetShaqjniawpx5dc2wiaeicLzKnKh7qug/640)  
*Words in image:* Deeply into the role

The afternoon passed fast, the filming has come to the end. By the way, the following scene was intended to reveal by the New Year, but is now a spoiler for the viewers of Toonmax after my unremitting efforts! Applaud~

![Image](http://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_gif/EXrxYhl6d1cEIxzibLqWuTcwGeLcQw8H0a3icCEOwBCW6D3YKw5AdMXrhBVic4Sr0dthPib0PG6zet7iaCVDRCKAicgQ/0)  
*Words in image:* Feeling exhausted

Eh? Who's the charming guy in red scarf? So shining!

![Image](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_jpg/EXrxYhl6d1f2YNrCDJI3XROHtIW0hKBGBIqr8OqGQWtWqJPsIjJm6E6xnlWcoAV0taUv179mQULykjU8sHG9GA/640)

As the tallest member of Yi An Music Club, FANG Xiang-rui has enviable long legs. And the attractive look is too hard to resist!

![Image](http://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_jpg/EXrxYhl6d1cEIxzibLqWuTcwGeLcQw8H0Zia0VxU3e1A55bniatR8TRZklKia6PJVjpxV6VkD75zBexLeghbtDKyWA/640)  
*Words in image:* Stop sending out the charm, you guy charming from head to toe!

Fang-fang on stage is charismatic like a prince. With the superior voice, he is a popular anchor in the radio show *Yi An Good Night* (易安说晚安).

P.S.: Friendly tip: It is not recommended to listen to the show at night, for the risk of insomnia and excessive loss of blood.

Back to the topic~

Fang-fang was very conscientious during the filming, had the script finished smoothly. A heart for Fang-fang~

*Words in image:* A heart for you

With the progress of the filming, they were gradually getting tired, and such a moment would sometimes came out:

![Image](http://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_gif/EXrxYhl6d1cEIxzibLqWuTcwGeLcQw8H0EaYQmBX4CIIsdFibicLtytdF68u4qiaS1kduP82HAWibS82XFIo9t2piaiaA/0)  
*Words in image:* Totally muddled

The expression when the director was talking was so cute. 11 marks for you, the extra 1 mark is for being proud!

The brother in scarf and seemingly confused is the leader of Yi An Music Club – HE Luo-luo. The leader should be presented in the last.

![Image](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_jpg/EXrxYhl6d1f2YNrCDJI3XROHtIW0hKBGtfzdBFro5t3MTA4ibv8XA2TE40X9ep5RZWR9r8MOOgR1wEvVWsyGpiaA/640)

HE Luo-luo is the leader but is also doted. He is so tender and sincere that the other players would trust him without any precondition when playing the game of Werewolf. The versatile boy is also skilled at several musical instruments. This is no doubt a huge plus. With the big blinking eyes,

![Image](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_jpg/EXrxYhl6d1cEIxzibLqWuTcwGeLcQw8H0sTPKa6ApkHic5GA6MNBpluScQrms7DuCz501d8eMhMARnUuIywIEp2g/640)  
*Words in image:* I am watching you.

Hmm, I got the sight!

In this visit, I saw the other side of the brothers. For example, the leader HE Luo-luo cannot remember the script at first, and was trying hard repeatedly by the side. One who tries to get over a difficulty is shining bright~

![Image](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_jpg/EXrxYhl6d1cEIxzibLqWuTcwGeLcQw8H0v3853QXiaIvBhia5rEEgYWsmpDYHzubFpOq98o23d9wgYzefmsIkoz7g/640)  
*Words in image:* This is how great our leader is

So, I am full of expectation for the future of Toonmax TV and of Yi An Music Club!

*Words in image:* I guess you are longing for their exclusive news~

As a fan … As a decent staff, I don't agree with that.
