We celebrate the coming of the new year. We invite the best friends, arrange the decoration at home, cook delicacies, and toast with friends. We say many blessings, and talk about our hopes. We run to chase the light, write the wishes on the sky lantern and see it fly to the sky afar.

We say farewell to the passing year. We are grateful for all the support and companionship, for every joyful moments filled with tears. In the new year, we sincerely hope what you hope and what you yearn for could be those written on the sky lantern, soar freely in the wind, and become twinkling stars in the sky.

May all your wishes come true in 2018.

**Sidelights**

1. About hand-held confetti shooters  
It is said that on the day of super handsome LIN Mo's birthday, each of the other boys had a confetti shooter hidden in clothes for the trick. But they were too engaged in the dance, a shooter dropped from the pocket. The swift LIN Mo picked it up at once, smashed the sketch and started his strike. ╮(￣▽￣)╭  
(A tip: Tricks can be risky, be cautious before it's carried out.)
2. ZHAN Yi-wen playing with his cat  
As the well-known cat servant in Yi An Music Club, ZHAN Yi-wen is always obedient before his *Baiwan*. One day, ZHAN Yi-wen stretched out his hand to cuddle *Baiwan*, and *Baiwan* hooked the front paws on him, he “ran out of ways but can't cast off”, and the garment was broken. You must know that he loves that sports brand so much, but this time, he has to taste the bitterness alone.
3. The “biased love”  
One day in the acting lesson, LIN Mo lost in a game. The leader HE Luo-luo asked him to dance with his bottom, which was colletively agreed. So LIN Mo had to make some moves with reluctance~ In order not to do that again, LIN Mo raised his morale, and didn't lose any more! However, he found that no one had received such “laurel” after him. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Then, he used his odd mind to recognise this as the “biased love” ヾ(◍°∇°◍)ﾉﾞ
