[#AiyoMyMum](https://weibo.com/p/100808215ccf1680dcdb6d26a30d9db2922918) Mum, this was the first time I write a letter to you. Many feelings rose in my mind. “The thread in the hand of the loving mother is woven into the roving son's garments.”<sup>[1]</sup> Thank you for your consistent and meticulous care. Thank you for your dedication! I love you! Forever! [◉ Flash Show Video](https://www.miaopai.com/show/KGcii7qgfTVqpU~~YNFuXOnlC8P3l~8p5apYyA__.htm)
