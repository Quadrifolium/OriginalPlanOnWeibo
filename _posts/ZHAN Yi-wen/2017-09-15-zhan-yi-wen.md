I re-watched *Spider-Man* in 1994 today. It's the memory in my childhood. The first super hero series I watched is *Spider-Man*. (So I'm really bored. ![feeling awkward](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/91/h_org.gif)![feeling awkward](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/91/h_org.gif))

[YiAnMusicClub-ZhanYiWen](http://weibo.com/u/6108090526): Er … I was not yet born in 1994, but the first super hero series I watched is *Spider-Man* in 1994. :stuck_out_tongue::stuck_out_tongue:

Note:
1. The animated TV series is [Spider-Man (TV Series 1994–1998 - IMDb)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112175/)
