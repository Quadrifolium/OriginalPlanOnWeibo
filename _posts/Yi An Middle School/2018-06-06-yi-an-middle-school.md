Hey~ We wish every student in Senior Grade 3 be success from the beginning and get a good score. Fighting! We are waiting for you in this summer~ In every episode of [#YiAnGoodNight](https://weibo.com/p/10080892b104a59bff303ca883e7931b5b916e/super_index), there seems to have some “big news” about Yi An boys leaked. At the same time, the boys get a troublesome topic for the debat – “is it right to press a friend for the payment of debt”. How do they think about it? At 21:00 on [@KilaKila](https://weibo.com/u/5990184179), don't miss it~ [◉ Flash Show Video](https://www.miaopai.com/show/tQgK9ShWwCraraG7OB9YXFXK7B9XtfogU3m4hQ__.htm)

SUN Yi-hang and FANG Xiang-rui became “the best game commentators”. Who won the final battle?  
What made LIN Jia-hao be defeated by SHEN Yi-sheng, and give up halfway?  
Please watch *Weird World in Yi An*!
