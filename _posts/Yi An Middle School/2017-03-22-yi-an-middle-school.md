**Words on the picture:**

At 5 a.m.,  
to get to school on time, I have to use versatile skills,  
like a kungfu master trying to take a place with all the strength.  
The metro follows the law of jungle,  
a small hesitate may cause a long delay.  
I have doubted whether the dream of being a teacher  
will result in failure since I was often late when I was a student.  
If I speak out the excuse of having loose bowels, being engaged in the family, or supporting a grandma to cross the road,  
it will only incur contempt,  
the trust with the students may be shattered at once.

On the same morning, as always did,  
I pressed down myriads of alarms, and rushed out of the door  
like a stray dog with stolen steamed bun in the mouth.

“Beep, Preferential Card For the Aged.”

After finished the warm-up at the metro gate,  
I started to search for the rivals as usual.  
An aunt at 10 o'clock, a child at 2.  
it is a too easy task for a vigorous man at 20s.

Taking hurried steps, pretending being pressed by gigantic thrust from behind,  
I was acting to my heart's content.  
At this moment, I can tell that I am a good actor.  
But I overlooked an aunt living her whole life in the jungle of Shanghai.  
The elegant steps twisting among the slits of the crowd are precisely calculated,  
the great tenacity is tempered in square dance for years,  
only a new urban legend is left behind.  
And the gap remained will soon be filled.

Not the aunt's path.  
I placed my sight on the short-statured child.  
It is better to skip the anomic procedure following.  
When I am playing the peacock after squeezed out the child at the last moment,  
what he spoke out makes me froze and stunned:

“Mister (Teacher) ?!”

When I looked back, the school badge of Yi An was dazzling my eyes,  
and my heart.  
The student's face showed he's on the edge of breaking down.  
Only apparitions know what was writhing in my heart.  
From the carriage, I pulled his arms and yanked,  
our bodies had the positions exchanged.

“Mister (Teacher) ?!”

“Beep beep …” the door closed.  
The train pulled out, with a dense mass of zombies.  
Countless people are still crowding on the platform.  
In the morning, these words came into my mind:  
“No matter how early I greet the morning, some others are already there.  
I thought the others are still dreaming, but  
no matter what time it is, this world is always one step ahead of me.”

But, being late occasionally may not be so bad.
