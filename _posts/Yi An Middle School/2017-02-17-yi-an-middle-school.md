For the class committee of Class 2 Senior Grade 2: Please attend the meeting for the week on duty with the teacher on duty, ZHOU Yu-sheng, at 5 p.m., in the Office of Moral Education. For the grade leaders: please submit the term schedule of your grade to the Office of Teaching Affairs before before off-duty time. Besides, Shanghai is experiencing temperature decline and rain, please put on more clothes to avoid getting cold in the weekend. After the short departure, I will welcome you at the school gate on Monday morning. ![heart](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/40/hearta_org.gif)

Since applying institution is the established practice abroad, why not implement it domestic? Experts' brains are hard to guess, when you talk about status quo, they stress on int'l convention. Yi An cannot change the current situation, but is striving towards the goal. And we hope more schools take part in quality-oriented education whole-heartedly. Only in this way can our students be more competitive. Exam score can never be the primary element for a student!
