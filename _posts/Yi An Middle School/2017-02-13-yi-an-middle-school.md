This morning, Yi An Middle School held the New Term Ceremony of the Second Term of the School Year of 2016–2017. At the ceremony, Principal Liu made the speech entitled “Historical Yi An, vivacious new life”, hoping that everyone in the school inherit the traditions and open up a new passage of Yi An. The class on duty – Class 1, Senior Grade 2 – made the Speech Under the National Flag with the topic of “Forge Ahead in the New Term”, hoping that everyone march forward courageously! ![thumb up](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/d8/good_org.gif)
