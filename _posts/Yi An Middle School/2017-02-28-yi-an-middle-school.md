After the third class in the afternoon, Yi An TV will broadcast the mobilisation programme for the speech competition themed “Happy Yi An, Vigorous Yi An” organised by the Student Union. Please watch on time in the classroom. And the Student Union calls for your participation. (Though it's indicated as voluntarily, it is recommended that each class apply for at least one programme.)
