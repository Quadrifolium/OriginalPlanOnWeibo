The 23rd and 24th of the twelfth month in Chinese calendar are the days for honouring the Kitchen God, in the tradition of China, which are also called *Xiao Nian* (小年, the minor New Year). As the saying goes, “after *Xiao Nian*, the new year is coming”. I have verified that the club activities during the two days are unusually brilliant: Literature Club and Arts Clubs will present couplets; the joint performance of Music Club, Chorus Club, Anime Club, and Street Dance Club tonight will be on stage in the basketball stadium; while an exhibition game of Football Club will be played on the football pitch tomorrow morning. Please join them. ![red envelope](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/e0/hongbao1_org.gif)
