[Notice on bicycle-sharing in campus] With the widespread usage of sharing bicycles in Shanghai, more and more students choose to go to and from school with them, which leads to more sharing bicycles placed in the parking lot in the campus. However, according to the rules, sharing bicycles should not be parked in plots, and the people outside cannot get into the campus to fetch them. In response to the standardisation of bicycle-sharing led by the municipal government, the management of the access of bicycles will be strengthened from the next week. Please place sharing bicycles in public parking lots around the campus to make it convenient for you and for others. The inheritance of the virtue of Yi An is on everyone of us.
