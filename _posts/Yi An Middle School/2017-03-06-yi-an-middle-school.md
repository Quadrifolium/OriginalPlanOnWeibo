In the morning assembly, the class on duty – Class 4 Senior Grade 2 made the Speech Under the National Flag with the topic of *Embellish Our Environment With Green*. 12th March is the Arbour Day. Every year, the students of Yi An claim a lot around the downtown and plant saplings, to contribute to the afforesting of the city with action. With the expansion of the city, environmental problems are sticking out, which makes afforestation more and more important. We hope our students be inspired by the event, realise the meaning of the environment to human beings, and embellish our environment with green!
