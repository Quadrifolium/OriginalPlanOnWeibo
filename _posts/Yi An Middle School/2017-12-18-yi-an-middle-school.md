Sunny. The Speech Under the National Flag was held by CCYL Committee with the topic of “Spotlight in riotous profusion, teenagers are poised for the journey”. The youth the students possess is just like the distant place the ancients had written, the time that only comes once. At present, no matter how green you are, the brightness and splendour can never be covered. Feel free to burst forth your talent, to kindle the fire in your heart, and let it burn for the whole life. At 20:15 this evening, the school will also focus on [@YiAnMusicClub](http://weibo.com/u/6094546964) in the Live Fest.
