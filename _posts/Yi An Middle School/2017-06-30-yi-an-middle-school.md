The second term of the school year 2016-2017 comes to the end today. The summer vacation will start tomorrow. I wish all the students a happy vacation. The check-in time for the next tern starts from 10 a.m., 2nd Sept. Please watch the time, don't be late. Meanwhile, for the students planning to use classrooms for festivals in the vacation, please apply for the access permit in summer vacation to the General Affairs Department today. No waiting after the time. Please pass on the information to each other.
