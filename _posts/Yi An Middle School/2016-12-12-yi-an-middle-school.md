Today, the Speech Under the National Flag made by Class 6 Senior Grade 1 is about observations of the sports meeting held last week. The students were jubilant and enthusiastic in the competitions, sweat spiritedly on the sport fields. With the bright and serene sky, the figures bathing in the warm sunshine of the early winter were more beautiful and charming. Later, the awards of the sports meeting will be published. Please pay attention to the notification. ![pleased](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/50/pcmoren_huaixiao_org.png)
