This monday is sunny, the Speech Under the National Flag from Class 3 Senior Grade 3 took place as usual. This week, the topic is “learn to use the fragments of time”, which mentioned that if one use 5 to 10 minutes per day for one thing, and share it with friends in one month, it must be very interesting and meaningful. I also think this will make the others look at you with new eyes. [Important notice] Notice from the Principal's Office and the Students' Associated Union: The one-week renovation of the old building has finished, it is decided herein that the building will be used for club activities, to relieve the shortage of rooms. The clubs with request may submit applications to the Students' Union this week. See the details on the bulletin board.
