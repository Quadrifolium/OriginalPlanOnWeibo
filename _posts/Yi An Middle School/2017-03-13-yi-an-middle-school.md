On this day in AD 1084, the talented woman Householder Yi An was born. In her poetry, there is graceful verse like “just got off the brows, but crept onto the heart” (才下眉头，却上心头), there is heroic verse like “alive, live a heroic life; dead, be a remarkable ghost” (生当作人杰，死亦为鬼雄). Students of Yi An must be very familiar with the works of Householder Yi An. On the date of her birth, please comment Householder Yi An's nice verse well-known to you ~

Today's morning assembly was cancelled due to the rainy weather. the class on duty – Class 5 Senior Grade 2 made the Speech Under the National Flag via Yi An Radio with the topic of *Make Our Voice Heard With Speech*. As the speech competition held by the Student Union is taking place vigorously, students from all classes are making excellent speeches with various topics. Through the competition, we are surprised to find that the expositions are well-grounded and well-ordered. Youth ought to be colourful, we hope the students gain improvement through the speech competition, and the voice of the contemporary middle school students be heard through speeches!
