About Yi An *Growth Plan*

At the beginning of the second semester of the school year 2017–2018, Yi An Middle School was labelled “Model School in Arts”, transformed from a sport-specialised school to one developing both arts and sports. In order to promote the strength and test the growth of the students, the school decided to carry out the activity named “Yi An Growth Plan”. The two in this year is planned to be launched in April and August.

Permitted participants: any student in Yi An Middle School  
Registration: Repost this notice with personal Weibo account  
Form of activity: The Students' Union will carry out a draw to divide the participants in groups

The members of each team should rehearse the appointed song or dance for the competition of *Growth Plan*. The draw will be live on the web.

During the competition, each team should give the show in turns. Teachers will give a mark to the performance of each student.

After the recording of the competition, the programme will be published on the web, for the other students and the parents. In the first week of the release, anyone who has watched the “Plan” could support the participants with coupons. The school will gather the scores from the judges and the coupons from viewers after the due date, and calculate the final scores, while the number of coupons determines the level of a participant. The final result will be live on the web.

The division of levels:  
1\. School-level: Participants with coupons ranked in the top 6.  
2\. Grade-level: Participants with coupons ranked No. 7–13.  
3\. Class-level: The others.

How do coupons work

Where to get coupons:  
In order to facilitate the data gathering, the coupons for the *Growth Plan* will be in “Yi An Fans” (易安饭) – the specific app for the parents of Yi An students, which will be released for iOS and Android.

What is coupons:  
During the month of the *Growth Plan*, “Themed photos for the Growth Plan” will be in the mall of “Yi An Fans”, the purchase of a set of photos will have 30 coupons appended to the account. An exchange card got during the seals collection before is worth of 500 coupons. Please open “Yi An Fans” app, choose “My – Coupons – Exchange”, and type in the key on the card.

How to use coupons:  
The coupons in your account could be sent to one or several of the participants, in the section of *Growth Plan* in the app. The number of coupons for each participant will not be shown during the period available for your operation.  
The period available: From the time the programme of *Growth Plan* is released, to seven days later, at 12:00. The specific duration will be announced after the *Growth Plan* is launched.

Note: The purchase of “themed photos for the Growth Plan” can also be used for the activity of “collecting photos for polaroids”. The collection of a full set is available for exchanging a polaroid of one or several of the students you designates. We sincerely remind you to buy only the amount you need.

The calculation on the coupons

The final result of each participants is integrated using the score from the judges and the coupons from viewers on-line. Among them, the score from the judges takes 40%, the coupons from viewers takes 60%.

How to convert:  
Suppose A and B are in the plan,  
A: 8.5 from judges, 1000 coupons  
B: 9.2 from judges, 900 coupons  
The total number of coupons = 1000 + 900 = 1900  
The total score from judges = 8.5 + 9.2 = 17.7  
Thus, 1900 : (17.7 × *n*) = 60 : 40,  
in which *n* = 71.536  
As a result,  
the corresponding coupons from judges for A is  
8.5 × 71.536 = 608.056  
the corresponding coupons from judges for B is  
9.2 × 71.536 = 658.1312  
Hence,  
the final result of A is 608.056 + 1000 = 1608.056  
the final result of B is 658.1312 + 900 = 1558.1312

Now, do you get the operation of the conversion?
