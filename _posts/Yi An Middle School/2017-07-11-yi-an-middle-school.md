When I pass by the canteen at noon, some students raised a concern that the mobiles taken over may be lost from the office, and hoped to “take a look”. The office director approved of the suggestion, and showed the cabinet to make them feel at ease. The cases are very safe, just rest assured and focus on the summer festival. ![very happy](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/58/mb_org.gif)
