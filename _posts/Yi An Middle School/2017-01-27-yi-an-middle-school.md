“The days and the matters are urging all the time. From *Dongzhi*, the *yang* starts to rise, and the spring is about to come.” (天时人事日相催，冬至阳生春又来。) The warm sunlight pours on the ground of Jiangnan, rewards the diligent teachers and students. At the end of the Year of *Bing Shen* the Monkey, on behalf of Yi An Middle School, I wish all the teachers healthy and successful in career, all the students grow happily and gain more knowledge! Please allow me send our sincere regards for the new year to all the alumni at home and abroad, to all the leaders and the people from all walks of life who care for and support the development of Yi An!
