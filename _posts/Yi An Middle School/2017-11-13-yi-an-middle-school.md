The Speech Under the National Flag was held by Class 5 Junior Grade 1, with the topic of “Be a Pioneer in Politeness and Etiquette”. Every word or action of a student in Yi An represents the image of the school. They hope every student could set up civilised practices for a better life. [Notice] After the discussion in Yi An Radio, the recording of Season 2 of the radio drama *The Adventure of Yi An Music Club* is determined. The meeting for the relevant teachers will be held this week. ![longing](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/37/moren_chongjing_org.png)![longing](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/37/moren_chongjing_org.png)![longing](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/37/moren_chongjing_org.png)
