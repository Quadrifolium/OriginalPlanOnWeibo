[Advertise for the losts] The students are exerting great efforts on the first day of the sports meetings, which shows wonderful competition. And every class had the rubbish in the certain area cleared after the last match today, which is repeatedly praised by the cleaner aunties. However, the aunties found many belongings in the stands area: keys, meal cards, exercise books, and wallets. Please claim your lost articles at the gatehouse tomorrow. ![Husky](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/74/moren_hashiqi_org.png)
