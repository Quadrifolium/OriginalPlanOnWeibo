Monday, sunny to cloudy. The new term started, everyone grew elder and reached the new level of school. The Speech Under the National Flag was held by the Principal's Office with the topic of “Be a dignified person, do things down-to-earth”. The achievement of a man lies on the behaviour he presents. The action on a matter takes thirty percent, while the conduct of the person takes up seventy percent. The speaker hopes that the students be friendly to and support each other, that the teachers united concertedly and strive together, to make Yi An Middle School better. In the new term, let's do it together! :heart:
