The cloudy day marks the beginning of a new week. Today, the Speech Under the National Flag was held by Class 2 Junior Grade 2 with the topic of “Insist on physical exercises”. These days, some students caught a cold due to the greatly fluctuating temperature. While it could be easy to infect each other since we are living together.
