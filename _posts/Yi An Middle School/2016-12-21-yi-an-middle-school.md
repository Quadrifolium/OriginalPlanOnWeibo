It is *Dongzhi* (Winter Solstice) today. Geographically, this is the day with the longest night and shortest daytime for the Northern Hemisphere. While in the 24 solar terms, it represents that the coldest period of a year has come. The canteen will provide mutton soup after school today, please have a taste for supper. ![smile](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/emimage/ee8196.png)
