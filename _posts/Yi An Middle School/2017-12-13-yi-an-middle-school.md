> [#NankingMassacre80thAnniv](https://weibo.com/p/100808b63f8eab9e7749aaa2f8fa45c01c9b19) [Today, repost to commemorate the departed compatriots] From this day in 1937, Japanese invaders captured Nanjing (Nanking). In 6 weeks, over 300,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians were massacred. In the disintegrated country, myriads of families were ruined. Today is the National Memorial Day for the dead in Nanking Massacre. We commemorate in the name of the nation, not only for remembering the history, but also for peace and justice! Engrave the past on the mind, may we the people be strong!
