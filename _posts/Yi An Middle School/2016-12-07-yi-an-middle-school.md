Having watching the rehearsal of the parade in the afternoon, I am greatly expecting the formal performance held tomorrow. ![huge](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/27/bba_org.gif) The room storing your costumes will be open at 8 a.m. tomorrow. Please take yours back on time. Teachers of P.E. section, please get to your position at 8 sharp. ![titter](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/19/heia_org.gif) No need to be verbose, we wish you achieve good results in the sports meeting. Dear students, fighting! ![thumb up](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/d8/good_org.gif)

Attention! Attention! Don't dress for the rehearsal of the parade of the sports meeting. This morning, the guard found many students coming with bizarre dresses, and even a student in bear costume. ![going crazy](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/62/crazya_org.gif) The teacher on duty said the costumes are piling up in the corridor! A room on the first floor of Building No. 2 in the old campus is open for storing. Please put your costumes there in breaks!
