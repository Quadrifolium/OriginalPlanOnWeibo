Monday, sunny. It's time for the Speech Under the National Flag. The speech this week was held by Class 6 Junior Grade 2 with the topic of “Go, for the final exams”. The year is coming to the end, it is less than a month before the final exams of this semester. In this year, all the students are progressing and growing gradually. As the saying goes, “sharpening makes a mighty sword, cold makes a blooming wintersweet”. In the upcoming exams, we hope every student gain excellent result for the teachers, and the parents.
