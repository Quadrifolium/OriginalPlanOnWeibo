It's the first day of the final examination today. How did that go? Well, the Office of Teaching Affairs has to single out a teacher-in-charge. This morning, all students in Class 7 Senior Grade 2 were late for the Chinese examination. After inquiry, this is caused by the wrong SMS sent by their teacher-in-charge, that the time was mistakenly shifted from 8:30 to 9:30 ![cover eyes](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/3c/pcmoren_wu_org.png). The Office hereby hopes no such low level mistakes be seen in the future.
