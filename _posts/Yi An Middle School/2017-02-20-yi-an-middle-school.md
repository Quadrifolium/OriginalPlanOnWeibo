This is the second week of the term. Class 2 Senior Grade 2 made the Speech Under the National Flag with the topic of *At the Time of the Cold Spring*. The speech mentioned that “a year's plan starts with spring”. Though the time welcoming spring is always the coldest period, the spring breeze will finally drive cold away, and bring vitality to the earth. Therefore, they hope the students not be scared by the difficulties on the road towards the dream, believe that the realisation will certainly come, the frustrations will eventually vanish.
