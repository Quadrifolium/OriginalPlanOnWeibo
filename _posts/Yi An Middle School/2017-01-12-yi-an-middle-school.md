We strongly remind parents, don't exert too much learning stress on your child. They are in the age of imagination and dream, exam score is not the only criterion of his/her future. Help him/her to grow up healthily and incubate the chasing of dream are what parents should do. ![heart](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/40/hearta_org.gif)

Second day of the final examination: Here comes the second day of the final examination. The guard at the gate has words: Several students were late this morning and didn't have time to take the bikes to the park, hence asked the guard for help. In consideration of the exam, the guard accepted the requests. But the key point is: don't be late for exams!
