Thumb up to students of Yi An! Today, joint managing activity of clearing unruly occupying stalls around the campus taken by the Logistics Department in alliance with District CUALEB faced obstruction from some pedlars. Some students on their way to school found out the situation, and communicated with them in courtesy, which finally resolved the problem that the pedlars left. You did a good job!
