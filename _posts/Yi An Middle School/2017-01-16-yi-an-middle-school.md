Students and parents applied for the open classes tomorrow should enter the school with the SMS receipt. Students in Class 5 Senior Grade 1 will guide at the gate. (Participants coming by car could use the parking lot of the school, but the elevator of the lot is out of service. Please return to the gate from the entrance.)  Club activities will be held at 5 p.m., after the open classes. You are welcome to visit and join them. Class committee of Class 5 Senior Grade 1 should remind volunteers to wear the winter uniform (windbreaker).
