Urgent notice! Affected by by a drop in temperature brought by cold air, a gale arrives in Shanghai. A report from the gate guard says that while students were resisting wind with thick clothes and even umbrellas, a thin student was suddenly blown onto the road. It's lucky that the traffic was not heavy, no accident has happened. We strongly remind you to pay attention to the road conditions while resisting the wind! And for thin students, please take more physical exercises!
