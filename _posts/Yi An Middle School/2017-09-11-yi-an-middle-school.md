The Speech Under the National Flag was carried on in Yi An Radio. Class 1 Junior Grade 1 made the speech with the topic of “Sharpening makes a mighty sword, and cold makes a blooming wintersweet”. In this new term, besides the lessons and homework, the students also joined the club activities actively. For the musical at the end of September, they are striving till nine or ten o'clock every day. I believe it will be an excellent show. [Notice from Students' Union] Take the long vacation into account, the promotion of the musical should be in progress this week. [Notice from Principal's Office] The teachers received the relevant SMS should attend the meeting on “Plan R” this Friday. No absence is allowed.
