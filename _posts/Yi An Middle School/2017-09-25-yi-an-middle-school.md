Rainy. The Speech Under the National Flag was held by Class 3 Junior Grade 1. The National Day is near, and the musical *24 Hours in Urgency* (音乐社告急的24小时) performed by the Music Club and other clubs will be on stage this Friday. We will organise the students to watch the show in batches. In order to make the performers focus on the show and not to influence them, we call on the observation of the convention, including not to photograph, eat, or drink. Besides, please pass the entrance before the show begins, and don't leave during the show. Please inform each other and follow the instructions. :heart:
