Last week, some student appealed that rooms for club activities are not enough. After discussion, school leaders have reached preliminary agreement that the three teaching buildings in the old campus will be open for clubs. The plan of all the old teaching buildings will be published within this week. Clubs having request may apply through Logistics Department. ![pleased](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/0b/tootha_org.gif) How about that? Am I fast this time? ![pitiful](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/af/kl_org.gif)

The class on duty, Class 7 Senior Grade 1, made the Speech Under the National Flag with the topic of “Stick national humiliation in mind, be a might teenager of China”. The last Tuesday is the National Memorial Day, all Chinese people were lamenting the death of our compatriots murdered in Nanking Massacre. Memorising the history is not to advocate hatred between nations, but in the hope that everyone should bear the agonising days in mind, strive to be strong, strive for a prosperous and strong nation. Only in this way can the oriental dragon be great again!
