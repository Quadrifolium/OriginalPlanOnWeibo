Today, Class 5 Senior Grade 1 made the Speech Under the National Flag with the topic of “Youth in rhythm”. Though it's December, your enthusiasm doesn't cool down with the lowering temperature, but are rising high. This week, Yi An Middle School will hold the Autumn Sports Meeting. We will see the striving figures on the fields again. Youth is in rhythm, youth needs striving! ![yeah](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/d9/ye_org.gif)
