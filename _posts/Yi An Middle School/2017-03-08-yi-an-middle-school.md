To dress neatly and decently is Article Two of the School Regulation of Yi An. This should be reflected not just on the body, but also on the treatment to the things around. This photo taken by a teacher of the P.E. team shows the mess in a locker. The clothes are not hung on the rack, but thrown on the floor, with the reason of being too delighted since there's no class in the afternoon, and didn't notice that. “An Yi Yang De” (安以养德), to put articles in order is also in the virtue! We hope our students cultivate small virtue in tiny things. This is the profound meaning of our school motto.
