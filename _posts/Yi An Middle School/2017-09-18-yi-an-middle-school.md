> [If you remember, pass on the history] 86 years ago, on 18th Sept. 1931, the Mukden Incident broke out. Since then, the Chinese nation was dragged in the 14-year bloody battles. More than half of the land of China submerged, over 35 million compatriots injured or died. Every inch of the land had their blood flowed, the trials we suffered are unable to forget, the sacrifice we paid can never be forgotten. [#Engrave918InHeart](http://weibo.com/p/1008086536cf4d739900f336b6ad35ded3aed6), pass on the history, for our compatriots, for our ancestors, for our rebellion!
