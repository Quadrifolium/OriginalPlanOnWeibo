Sunny. The Speech Under the National Flag was held by Class 3 Junior Grade 2 with the topic of “Being honest”, starting with a story: There was once a king who was looking for the successor. He summoned many boys and gave them seeds, claimed that the one breeds the most beautiful flower will be the successor. After a period of time, most of the boys brought beautiful flowers back, only one with a sole pot. But this boy was chosen. It turned out that all the seeds were boiled and cannot have flowers grown. At times, the life is not for being colourful and splendid, but simple and pure.
