**Words on the image:**

The matter is like this:

It is Qingming Festival, but the monthly exam has just ended, the Chinese, Maths, and English teachers still have to grade the papers in the school.

Based on the principle of educating people (suffering together), the teachers in Arts, Music, History, and P.E. also come to help.

The History teacher went crazy.

“No one made a correct answer on this poem analysis. Who taught them Chinese?”

In subconscious, we dart a look at the P.E. teachers who are often made a scapegoat … (Translator's note: There is a catchphrase that when expressing that someone does poorly in Chinese, Maths, or another course, a person would say that his/her course is taught by the P.E. teacher.)

The P.E. teachers' expression:

The question is about a poem of DU Mu (杜牧, 803–852) – Qingming Festival (清明):

“It drizzles endless during the rainy season in spring,  
Travelers along the road look gloomy and miserable.  
When I ask a shepherd boy where I can find a tavern,  
He points at a distant hamlet nestling amidst apricot blossoms.  
(Translator's note: the poem is translated by YANG Xian-yi (杨宪益) and DAI Nai-die (戴乃迭).)

“Please summarise the sentiment the poet expressed in brief, with no less than 50 characters.”

This question made all the students annihilated.

And then, we were forced to have a History lesson in the office …

As to Qingming Festival, it is in fact not a very important festival in ancient time.

As to the third month in Chinese calendar, what came to people's mind are the two elder brothers – Shangsi Festival (上巳节, on the third day of the third month) and Cold Food Festival (寒食节, on the day before Qingming Festival).

What is Shangsi Festival for? Use the words at present, it is to exorcise evil spirits, date, and collect drift bottles — to play together.

On that day, people pluck willow branches and take cold baths. When find a guy with eight packs, the girl may bring him home.

As to the origin of the Cold Food Festival, there is a weird story:

In the Spring and Autumn period (c. 771 – 476 BC), Duke Wen of Jin (晋文公) was exiled with his friends. One day, he fainted from hunger. A follower, JIE Zi-tui (介子推), cut a piece of flesh from his own thigh to make soup for the duke.

Later, Duke Wen of Jin became celebrated. But JIE Zi-tui was disillusioned with the mortal world, hid himself in a deep mountain.

This duke was also a freak. As a monarch, when quarrelling with this subject (couple), he just wanted to solve it with “blazing fire on dry wood”. He set fire to the mountain, and JIE Zi-tui was roasted.

People are still wondering if JIE Zi-tui was examplary or too late to escape.

And then, to cherish the momery of him, Duke Wen of Jin banned playing with fire for a period of time. To respond to the call, people arranged ancestor worship in this festival.

Just experienced cold bath in Shangsi Festival, and had cold food for several days, one had to make a good cry in front of tombs. Even a brawny man can hardly handle it.

So, people moved their sight to the day which was simply a solar term, not a festival but very close to the Cold Food Festival.

The general meaning is: I didn't get to the end, but you have started already. It is too hard to accept the fact. So on the day of Qingming, our ancestors flew their minds away – twinks play cuju (蹴鞠), compete with game fouls, eat in restaurants; beauties are busy watching operas and gentlemen; people do whatever they can on the day.

The time got to Tang dynasty (618–907), which was the era DU Mu lived.

The people at that time were somewhat like the Americans at present.

That is – to enjoy.

To have cold food and sweep tomb in a festival can never be their style.

So, they blended the Cold Food Festival with Qingming.

(Image)

That means, after crying hard in front of ancestors, they would quickly turn the topic to discussing the tour next.

So, disco at tomb is not an invention of modern people.

Though the official had prevented such twisted practice: “Isn't your conscience aching?”

Nobody can stop the playful ancestors.

What is the most critical, with the popularisation of Qingming Festival, people were celebrating it longer and longer – play cuju, compete with game fouls, walking, … with great joy. In Song dynasty (960–1279), due to some political reasons, it took over the place of Shangsi Festival and Cold Food Festival.

If you still cannot understand why they like to see it happen, just consider like this:

Will you be happy if you have a long vacation?

Now get back to that poem.

Just asking for tavern didn't mean that he's going to drown his sorrows in wine.

He had no sorrow at all!

After gnawing cold buns for two days,

he should get a sequence number there for his friends,

and maybe there was a cuju game after the dinner.

I don't know whether all these are the solemn nonsense from the History teacher.

But I can imagine the muddled expression when the students get their papers back.

Anyway, Happy Qingming Festival …
