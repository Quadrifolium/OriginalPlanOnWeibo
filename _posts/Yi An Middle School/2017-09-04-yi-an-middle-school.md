Cloudy. After the long-time absence, the Speech Under the National Flag resumed to the right track. This week, the speech was held by the Students' Union with the topic of “Excellence, Wisdom, Unity”, which hopes that the new students could attend club activities actively to cultivate the interest and enrich the campus life, and encourages the learning between clubs for winning honour for the school with more excellent performance.
