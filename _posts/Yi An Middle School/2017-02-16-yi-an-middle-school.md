Dear guardians: Do you want to see a healthy and happy child, or a robot specified for school study and exams? Yi An always implement quality-oriented education, hoping that our students reach their prime in a harmonic and relaxed environment! And we hope the parents could achieve this goal!

“Marching Drumbeats” wins praise! Have you noticed the bright and brave marching drum performance at the opening ceremony of the new term? This show is from Class 2, Junior Grade 1! We'd like to thank Mr./Ms. Xiao for the one-week instruction, and to thank the performers of Class 2 Junior Grade 1 for their assiduous training and wonderful performance!
