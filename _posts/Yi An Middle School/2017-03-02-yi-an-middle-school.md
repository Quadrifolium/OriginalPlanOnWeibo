Chinese class can be like this? Principal Liu is really cool! This afternoon, Principal Liu gave a fresh class to the students of Grade 8, with the teaching of *Shuidiao Getou* written by SU Shi. At the beginning of the lesson, Principal Liu turned on the music, sang the *ci* with a composition, and asked the students to judge his singing. The students didn't miss the chance to vent his bad singing skill. Principal Liu smiled and proposed to have some students compete about the song. After several rounds, the students started to doubt whether this is a Chinese lesson. At this time, Principal Liu asked in no hurry: Have you remembered the verse? It turns out that the competition is to make the students remember the verse unconsciously. A member of the Music Club was enlightened, and told Principal Liu that the Music Club will compose with the *ci* of Householder YI An, to elimiate the worries in reciting Song *ci*! Then, Principal Liu encouraged the students that be bold to practise, the idea will finally be implemented!
