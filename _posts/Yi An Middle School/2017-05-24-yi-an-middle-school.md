Note:
1. “The other one's middle school” (别人的中学) is adapted from a buzz phrase “the other one's child” (别人家的孩子), which represents a peer who is often set as an example by one's parents by saying: “Look at some other family's child. See what s/he has achieved”, which add much pressure to the person.
