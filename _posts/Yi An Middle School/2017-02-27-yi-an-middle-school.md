Good morning for Monday of the third week of the term. ![applaud](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/36/gza_org.gif) Class 3 Senior Grade 2 made the Speech Under the National Flag with the topic of *Yi An On Longtaitou*. The second day of the second month of the Chinese calendar is called “Longtaitou” in folk custom. In the days around the festival, spring comes back to the earth, the saying that “dragon rises its head on Eryue'er” spreads. The students of Yi An are also moving forward and striving to make progress, while the developing Yi An is bound to have its head raised with the great efforts of the students.
