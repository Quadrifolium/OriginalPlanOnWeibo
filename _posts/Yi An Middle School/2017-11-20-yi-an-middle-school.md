The Speech Under the National Flag was held by Class 6 Junior Grade 1, with the topic of “Learn to Understand”. Yi An Middle School is a small society. Besides the pressure in course learning, the diversified club activities are also enhancing the communication among us. We are from different classes or grades, there may be inevitable conflicts when gaining friendship. At this time, we need to learn to understand and be active to change. The elder should take care of the younger, while the younger respect the elder. The tiny tolerance may forge a warm family with a new face.
