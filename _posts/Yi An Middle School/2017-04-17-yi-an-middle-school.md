Due to the heavy rain at dawn and the uncertain weather change, the Speech Under the National Flag held by Class 2 Senior Grade 3 was broadcast via Yi An Radio. The topic in this week is “Abidy by School Regulations and Discipline, Create a Bright Future Together”, which expressed that besides study, the students should set strict demands on oneself. It specially mentioned that in the days approaching the college entrance examination, the students in Senior Grade 3 cherish the school uniform very much, and would polish and adorn the school emblem every day. If this was only the code of conduct in the past, it has now become wistfulness. What is surprising, the director of the Office of Students Affair made a statement afterwards, that whenever the time is, you are always the students of Yi An Middle School; learning is an endless process, the school welcome you at any time. This initiated prolonged applause among students.
