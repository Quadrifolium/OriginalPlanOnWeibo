It's sprinkling today, the Speech Under the National Flag was taken place on Yi An Radio. The topic Class 4 Senior Grade 3 focused on is “Honesty and Integrity”, in which the words of Shakespeare – “The loss of integrity is equal to the destruction of oneself”, was quoted. In the current critical situation with doubts from parents, Yi An Middle School will act on the school motto “cultivate virtue via peace and comfortable environment”, correct wrong individual behaviour. Meanwhile, as “the problem in teaching owes to the idleness of the teacher”, the teachers of Yi An Middle School will also make solemn self-criticism.

Note:
1. The original quote of Shakespeare is not clear yet.
