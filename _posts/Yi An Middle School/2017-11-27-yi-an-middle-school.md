The Speech Under the National Flag was held by Class 1 Junior Grade 2, with the topic of “Be diligent”. As the saying goes: “Achievement is founded on diligence and wasted upon recklessness.” To get a good score, the everyday diligency is a must. There may be a stop to rest during the progress, but it cannot be the final destination. In the coming days less than two months, please cherish the time and study hard, wait for the final exam with full enthusiasm!
