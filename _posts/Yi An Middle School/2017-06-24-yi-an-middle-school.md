*Words in image:*  
Usually, there's only one correct answer for the question in the entrance exam.  
If you didn't pick it out, you will be unqualified.  
This is cruel.  
However,  
the life is not like this.  
There are many correct answers for your life.  
To study in college is,  
not to study there is,  
the devotion in sport is,  
the interest in music is, playing with friends is,  
making a detour for someone is.  
All these may be the correct answers.  
Thus,  
don't fear to live.  
No matter you are admitted or not,  
don't deny the possibilities in your body.  
Stick out your chest, be bold to live.

Note:
1. “All things in their being are good for something” (天生我才必有用) is from the poem *Bringing in the Wine* (将进酒) written by LI Bai (李白; 701–762).
