Don't catch the meaning of idioms too literally! The teachers have once talked in the office: “One day, Andromeda and the Milky Way will merge together.

The P.E. teacher thought for a while and said: Maybe, all of us will be fairies? ![Husky](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/74/moren_hashiqi_org.png)
