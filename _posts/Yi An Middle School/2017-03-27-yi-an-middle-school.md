It is sunny today, the Speech Under the National Flag resumed after two weeks. The speech made by Class 7 Senior Grade 2 talked about the end of the Arguing Competition (the title is changed due to force majeure), though temporary replacement happened sometimes – especially the contestant FANG Xiang-rui, who weighed rivals down or even made them be silent with peculiar entry points and jumping ways of thinking, which was never seen before. The host called for strengthening the accumulation of knowledge out of class through the competition, and Principal Liu discussed the topic of “like” and “love” with the students.

The difference between “like” and “love”  
— An answer from the Buddha  
When you like a flower, you would pick it off.  
When you love a flower, you would water it.  
From this, you will know the meaning of life.

But it soon became clear that you just didn't know how to express the feelings, hence hided your mind deep. You are kind-hearted and generous in friendship. When getting familiar with you, everyone would like to say: Nice to meet you again.
