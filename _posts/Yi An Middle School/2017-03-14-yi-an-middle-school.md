[Fascinating int'l situation] For the sake of understanding the changing int'l situation and experiencing different customs and practices, the Model World hosted by the Politics teaching group in combination with all the grades has been carried out in every class. As required, each class plays the role of a country, and interact with the other “countries” according to the “domestic” laws and interests. At the end of the term, the best “country” chosen will be awarded. Guess which class this is. ![titter](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/19/heia_org.gif)
