Dear students, another weekend! Wish you have happy days~ I know the final examinition is only one month ahead, but, don't tie yourself to the school study. Yi An always stresses alternating study with rest! If homework and course review are done, do go out for a rest! I am also going to relax, for reviving full spirit and energy for the coming weekdays. Right? ![grin](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/50/pcmoren_huaixiao_org.png)

It's quite cold at dawn and dusk these days. The teacher on duty found that many students are covered in scarf, mask, earmuff, and hats, with only a crack on the eyes. Keeping warm is essential, while at the same time, please watch the traffic carefully. Be in safety and peace is the most important matter. ![thumb up](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/d8/good_org.gif)
