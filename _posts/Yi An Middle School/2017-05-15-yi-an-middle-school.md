It's cloudy in the morning, the Speech Under the National Flag from Class 5 Senior Grade 3 was not affected, with the topic of “Carry forward the traditional culture”. From the principal Chinese characters to familiar Tang and Song poems, Chinese Traditional Medicine, traditional festivals, etc., alll these are the treasure passed on from our ancestors. As in the long-standing school, the students of Yi An should guard and inherit the fine traditional culture. We hope everyone do as the saying goes: “Heaven, in its motion, (gives the idea of) strength. The superior man, in accordance with this, nerves himself to ceaseless activity.”

1. The character in the image is “陽” (yáng; bright), while the shadow shows another character – “陰” (yīn; dark). “Yin and yang” is a concept in Chinese philosophy which expresses duality.
1. The saying quoted in the end comes from *I Ching* (易经; Classic of Changes), one of the oldest Chinese classics which was written in late 9th century BC. The original text is: “天行健，君子以自強不息”.
1. The Chinese characters in the above notes are in traditional form.
