It's cloudy today, the Speech Under the National Flag resumed. ZHAN Yi-wen from Class 2 Junior Grade 1 hosted the speech with the topic of “Oh”. Someone said, even if been bitten by a mad dog, we cannot bite it in return. We have many cherished friends and family members, we have greater dream and goal, but the time is limited, we can't waste our own time on meaningless matters, since we are always busy. – The above words are made up, the actual speech contains only “Oh (be indifferent)”.
