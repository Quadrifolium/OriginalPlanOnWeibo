Weekend again, do you feel sad? That's two days without seeing our dear teachers. ![shed tears](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/9d/sada_org.gif) So do I, since I can't see my dear students. ![pitiful](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/af/kl_org.gif) Entering December, the weather is getting cooler. Remember to put on more clothes before going out. Don't get cold~ Besides, We will hold the sports meeting in the coming week. I've checked the weather for you, it's a sunny weekend. ![very happy](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/58/mb_org.gif) Do your warm-up for the sports meeting! ![mighty](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/70/vw_org.gif)

During the thoroughly applying of the policy of “diversify campus” proposed by the principal in the beginning of this school year, grade deans and teachers-in-charge actively guide students to set up clubs. The result is fruitful, that by the end of Nov., 23 new clubs were found by students. We hope our students savour different school life amid club activities. ![applaud](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/36/gza_org.gif)×2
