**Translation suspending**

(Weibo posts since 1st May will be added after the translation restores.)

<!-- more -->

Due to the fatal hardware failure of my personal laptop, and the fact that the working laptop I am currently using is in Windows 7, which cannot run the assistive UWP gadget I wrote for doing the job, the translation of Weibo posts has to be suspended for an unknown period of time.

Video translation of the new radio series will still be published (slowly) on YouTube. Check [About]({{ '/about/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) page for the link.
