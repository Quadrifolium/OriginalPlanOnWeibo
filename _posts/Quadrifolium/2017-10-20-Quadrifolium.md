**About the current situation**

<!-- more -->

Due to a widely known large-scale event holding in mainland China these days, all the methods I use to get access to websites cut off by the authority here (YouTube, Twitter, etc.) are temporarily unavailable. This situation is supposed to continue till the end of October, thus the YouTube channel and the Twitter account cannot be updated during the period.

In view of this, please follow or check my accounts on LOFTER and Sina Weibo (see [About]({{ '/about/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) page) for relevant information to be updated.
