> [@YiAnMusicClub-ChiYi](http://weibo.com/u/6117581836) were friends of HE Luo-luo, and LIN Mo in childhood, but moved to another place with parents when he's in elementary school. When this term began, his name appeared on the class-assigning list. It's by no means accidental for the football lover to transfer back for schooling. He is well-behaved and courteous to everyone. Will he be a good memeber of the Music Club? On 14th Feb., the new term will see it.
