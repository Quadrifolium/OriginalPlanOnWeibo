SUN Yi-hang:  
Firstly, congratulations, you are now 16-year-old. I just find that the six of us had known each other for a long time. From the strangeness in the beginning to the friendship at present, with all the things we encountered together, the joys and sorrows therein are the feelings only we know. I feel we have been indivisible since a long time ago. We had agreed that we would celebrate each one's birthday together, but now you are away alone. Mm …  
What I would like to say here is from all the five of us:  
It's getting cold, put on more clothes.  
Your face's too thin, eat more food.  
Take care of yourself.  
Come back early.  
We are waiting.  
We may celebrate your next birthday together.  
Happy birthday. :gift:  
And, I found a photo we took last year. I'd pretend we are celebrating by your side.
