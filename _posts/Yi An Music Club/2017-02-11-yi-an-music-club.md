[@YiAnMusicClub-ZhanYiWen](http://weibo.com/u/6108090526), a top student with high I.Q. in classmates' and friends' eyes, a perfect student in teachers' eyes. The aloof and detached guy is actually brisk in mind. He wants to break away from the route set by his parents, is longing for friendship. Will ZHAN Yi-wen find the persons accompanying in his youth in this term?

ZHAN Yi-wen (Top student in Class 2, Junior Grade 1)  
Aloof and detached, always keep a distance away from others, but is extremely longing for friendship in the heart. Perfect student in teachers' eyes, but is actually brisk in mind – full of scheming and resourceful ideas.
