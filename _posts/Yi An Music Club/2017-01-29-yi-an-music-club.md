The Music Club members are too dawdling. Just the greeting were lagged from the New Year's Day to today. Look, we planned to send out regards on the day, but everyone was busy scrambling for red envelopes on the Eve. The door of the Music Club was open until yesterday afternoon. But better later than never, every day till the Lantern Festival is in the festival. Members of the Music Club would like to send out best regards to all of you, we wish you: auspicious in the Year of the Rooster, and everything goes well with you. ![red envelope](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/e0/hongbao1_org.gif)
