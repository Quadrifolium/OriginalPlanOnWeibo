HE Luo-luo  
Diary ⑵

The weather: super hot + stuffy. The mood: good as yesterday.

We had the dance class today, from the morning to the night.

“Dance, with all your strength.”  
“Don't slack.”  
“Wrong, once again.”

It's already 10:30, quite late. :zzz: I forgot to write this in the morning, so I have to do it in the night. Hihi!!

Today, Fang-fang bought a lamp for the first time, and was happy to tell us in the morning: “Look, I bought a lamp. We don't have to fear the dark in the night.” However, once we returned to the dorm, the lamp was broken. At present, he is still chattering near me: “What a lamp. Why is it broken?”

“FANG Xiang-rui, it's time to bathe. What are you doing?” ← Assistant  
Fang-fang → “No, I should check what's the problem.”  
“Have some fruit.” ← Auntie manager  
Fang-fang → “Fruit? Time for fruit.” And left the lamp behind. 😊 Haha!! ← I can't stand it anymore, a foodie comes out.

SUN Yi-hang comes, with the *dudou* <sup>[1]</sup> LIN Mo gave him as a gift <sup>[2]</sup>, and said: “I'm coming, everybody.” Haha, gracious, he's also barebacked …

All right. It's getting late. Night! :zzz:

Note:
1. *Dudou* (肚兜), a traditional Chinese form of the bodice.
2. When recording the show *I Got a Brother*, LIN Mo bought *dudou* for SUN Yi-hang and FANG Xiang-rui. His live on mobile included the shopping section.

Recently, the topic of [#YiAnGoodNight](http://weibo.com/p/10080892b104a59bff303ca883e7931b5b916e) is no others but one word: Hot! The “magic metropolis” is too hot, they expressed the wish to keep away from the heat in Africa. Don't marvel at the current temperature, take a look at the weather forecast, 39 degrees Celsius is waiting for you. :blush: Listen to the radio and sleep with ice in arms.

Note:
1. “Magic metropolis” (魔都) is a nickname of Shanghai. This name is first used by Muramatsu Shohu (村松梢風).
1. Chinese people usually take Africa as a very hot place, but recently there came out the news that an African got heat stroke in Beijing, which overturned the stereotype.
