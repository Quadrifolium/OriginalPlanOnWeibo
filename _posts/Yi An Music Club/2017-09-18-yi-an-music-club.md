The city, the home, the flavour. Today's note is about the favourites of food in the family of Yi An. The *Ichiban* CHI Yi is taking on the responsibility of feeding the club? As to the food, what they cherish the most is no doubt the taste at home. The study is pressing, please have a good appetite and a good sleep~ ![love you](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/6d/lovea_org.gif) Keep away from junk food and live a healthy life~ [◉ Music Club Jottings E06](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av14582535)

Note:
1. The appellation of “*Ichiban* CHI Yi” is derived from a TV animated series adapted from the manga *Chūka Ichiban!* (中華一番!), which is about a boy skilled in Chinese cuisine.
