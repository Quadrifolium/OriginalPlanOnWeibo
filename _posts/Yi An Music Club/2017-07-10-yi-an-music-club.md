Reading makes a person happy. Writing makes one thing meaningful.

Diary　　HE Luo-luo  
HE Luo-luo's diary ⑴ (← Trying to add more words)  
Mood: 😑　　Weather: Clear to Cloudy　　10th, June (Translator: He made it wrong)

It is eight o'clock in the evening. Actually, I was forced to write this diary by Alumnus Huang (Translator: the CEO HUANG Rui), boo-hoo! Yesterday, Alumnus Huang had his hair cut, that's so ugly that I don't know how to express it! (Maybe he cut it today …)

It seems I'm the first to write the diary. And I don't know what to write. Perhaps I may talk about what the other five little cadres are doing.

First of all, LIN Mo (← Imitating his sign) is recording a radio show. And I, am writing this diary upstairs. Thanks to the several-thousand-word self-criticism we wrote, at present, it's easy to write only four hundred characters. (Translator: Such a page for writing composition has 400 blocks.)

SUN Yi-hang is preparing for his second recording.

CHI Yi and ZHAN Yi-wen are in the dancing room.

As to FANG Xiang-rui, guess where he is!! Wrong! He is certainly sleeping!  
(Stick figure) ← Wardrobe  
↑ FANG Xiang-rui (New post for sleep)  
↑ (He can even sleep when standing, let alone lying in a wardrobe.)

All right. That's all. I'm afraid they will beat me when they find this.

In fact, CHI Yi may take one bath in ten days. (Please keep it secret 😊)

I can give a concert in the universe!
