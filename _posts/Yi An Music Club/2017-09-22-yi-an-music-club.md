It is time for *Triple Kill* to say goodbye. Thank you for your concern during the months, and we are grateful for the prize provider – [@JVCChinaOfficial](http://weibo.com/everio). Today, as before, we prepared the great prize for you – hit JVC headset which the members of Yi An Music Club are using. Commment and repost before 20:30, guess who is the final MVP. We will draw two lucky friends from those who made the correct guess. Don't miss the chance! (You may give the name of only one member once. Over one member or over one guess will not be counted. The result will be shown on Monday.)
