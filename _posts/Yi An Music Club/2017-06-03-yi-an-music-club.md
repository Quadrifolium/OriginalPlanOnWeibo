[Apology] Being attacked by some mysterious organisation, the Music Club is raising Bit Coin to redeem the data in a hurry. The release date of the anime of [#YiAnMusicClub](http://weibo.com/p/100808beae2e3e05b17b64f63ebedca39f19b2) is postponed. To express our apology, today's schedule for the anime is replaced by the radio drama *The Adventure of Yi An Music Club – The Misty School* E01, along with the complete audio of *Freeze the Memory* (定格纪念) and the audio clip of *Future Etude* (未来练习曲) as the ending song of the anime. We apologise for the accident. [❏ Link](http://m.ximalaya.com/78339006/album/8444050)
