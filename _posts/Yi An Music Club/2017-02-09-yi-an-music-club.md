[@YiAnMusicClub-SunYiHang](http://weibo.com/u/6108316220), though transfered to this school halfway, he can be acquainted with anyone quickly, and be friends with anyone after several words. He is deliberate in the heart and often do things in silence. He doesn't talk much, but is unexpectedly adept at controling the situation. Whose thoughts will SUN YI-hang with high E.Q. see through in the new term starting from 14th Feb.?
