A post specially for this: After the (very democratic) vote of all the members of the Music Club, the club song will be released with the publication of Yi An Music Club at the end of the next month. In order to be worthy of your waiting, there will not be only one song. ![pitiful](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/af/kl_org.gif) Besides, if the club song makes you satisfied, don't forget to come and praise me. ![kiss](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/6d/lovea_org.gif)
