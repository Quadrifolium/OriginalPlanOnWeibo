Though the “magic metropolis” is grilled under the sun, they still like morning jogging. So nice. :blush:

YAN Hao-xiang  
Diary

Today is another whole day for training. The body's exhausted, but it's quite good to write a diary to record the life in the day.

In the morning jogging, I have known this would also be a scorching day. Just as expected, the temperature is getting higher and higher till the afternoon. But one thing deserves to be mentioned is that there came a rainstorm in the afternoon. When I was in the training room and heard my *ge* (Translator: SUN Yi-hang) said it's raining, I didn't believe it at first, and questioned: “Impossible. It's a clear sunny day in the morning.” Until I get to the door and heard the sound of the rain. By the way, there's one thing deserves to be mentioned today. During the break in the afternoon, OU Meng was running by my side. In a curious coincidence, I grabbed his arm quickly and told him in solemnity: “Don't run fast in the agency. It's crowded, and easy to hit someone. Now you may go, don't trip up.” Watching OU Meng walk away, I suddenly found the feeling of being *gege*. Haha, it feels pretty good.

All right, that's all for today. It's time to wash and sleep.

CHI Yi's diary  
15th July　　Saturday　　Sunny :sun_with_face:

Passing through the yellow curtain, the sunlight dyed the whole room into golden yellow. It felt warm. Suddenly, someone pulled me out of my dream, the warm room also turned cold. I was thinking: “Let it be cold.” But … that person with “mosaic” on body said: “Get up and go jogging!” OMG! I … I … I will go! Then I quickly got dressed, brushed teeth, washed face and hair, …

“Get ready? Go!” With the command, we started the morning jogging. The sun was more and more dazzling, and I felt I was more and more tanned. But we can't stay away from the sun, so just let it be tanned, it indicates the health~ Such words were washing in my brain. Until – I was paralysed on the bed. That was the end of the jogging.

And the training came. The packed training fills every day. Though it's great, we can't use air-con, to avoid getting cold. So the room was stuffy. How I hope to get training outside and enjoy the wind, but … I have to accept it! T﹏T CHI Yi, brave it, go for it! (Stick figure) ← Striving :fire::fire::fire:

At last, I'll tell you a secret about our leader! Mr. Leader – HE Luo-luo. If Mr. Leader is in the room with me, when I'm using whitening products, he will say: Don't use that, or CHI Yi's skin will be lighter than me!

That's all for today! Never tell Mr. Leader what I exposed!

Good night, everybody!  
Have a good sleep!  
(Stick figures)
