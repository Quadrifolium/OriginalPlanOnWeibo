Notice on watching the musical

<!-- more -->

As the premiere of the musical approaches, we would like to stress the following points about watching the performance. Please abide by the rules and conventions.

1. In order to make the audience immersed in the show, the auditorium is placed very close to the stage, there is less than one metre between the stage and the first row. Differing from concerts, no isolation is set for the show. Therefore, please don't rush to the stage and interfere the normal progress of the show.
2. Any performance has its convention. We know clearly that you are eager to photograph or film, that the spreading of the photos and videos will be a promotion for the show. But we don't want to see the destruction of the convention of theatre performing. Like the rules in watching films, musicals, and operas, any means of photographing or filming is not permitted during the whole course of this show. We hope the audience in the theatre could get into the story among the members of Yi An Music Club, and enjoy the joyous and moving 90-minute. We have a professional team to record the whole performance, and will publish the relevant materials as soon as possible. Meanwhile, we will also choose one session to broadcast on a live platform, to bring more friends into the theatre.
3. Please follow the guidance of stage plays and operas. With the progressing of the plot, you may laugh, make noise, cry, or interact with the performers. But do please remember not to shout throughout the show. This is a show with ups and downs, not a concert motivating all along. Your reaction will influence the state of the performers. The best support for them is the applause at the end of each act.

The members of the Music Club will also state the above notice before every session of the show. Please abide by the rules and conventions.
