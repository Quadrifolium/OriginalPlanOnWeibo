LIN Mo  
Diary

Recently, I find! That after I wrote a long diary, everyone started to write more than one page. But … Forget it, better skip it. You'll take a beating. Next, I will talk about what happened today! (Don't focus on my handwriting any more.) For the other five in the Music Club: You may imitate the amount of characters I write, but you can't imitate my style! My style! My style! Yes, my style is to mock you back. Yes! To mock you.

Talk about things yesterday first! Yesterday, after ZYW (writing the names really bothers, I'll use initials in capital instead hereinafter) arrived home, he just found he forgot to write the diary. Then he went to ask the assistant, but there's no quadrille paper left, so he used a blank paper. Yes! It's not a plain blank paper, but the back side of the script paper in the room. Excuse me! It's my paper. Have you noticed: there is a staple on the top left of ZYW's diary! Take a look! It must be there! After finished, ZYW counted the number of characters to check if it reached the limit. He counted one after another carefully, and was very happy when finished. He said with joy: Wow! I wrote more than 200 characters *lene*<sup>[1]</sup>! Yes! These days, when finished a sentence, they like to add the pet phrase <span style="border:1px solid; border-radius:50%; display:inline-block;"><i>lene</i></span> at the end. Yi An Girl Group! I have nothing to say …

The second, HLL. This guy, I nearly collapsed last night, it's too ridiculous, haha. It's like this. Last night, I was lying on bed and read a book, an e-book. Before this happened, I have asked, Luo-luo, are you sleeping? He didn't answer. All right, he's asleep. Not long after this, I heard something coming from the upper bunk, the sound of colliding with the board was loud. I was startled, and thought Luo-luo was fouling me. Then, there came vague words, it's like this: “Don't touch me! Aiya, so annoying. Don't touch me, don't touch, please. Aiya, *00x%Cx$QQ…” You can't imagine how stunned I was. Later, I got out of bed to take a look at Luo-luo. The quilt was kicked away, with less than a half body covered. And I tucked HLL in. Don't forget you owe me 10 yuan. I have nothing else to say. Being on the bunk under yours is never lack of <span style="border:1px solid; border-radius:50%; display:inline-block;">surprise</span>!

The third, CY. Your IQ is getting lower and lower. I admit we are a little disturbing these days, and often shake the bed. But don't take this as your excuse! Remember, bear in mind! On that day, no, no, no, just a few days ago, SYH and ZYW and FXR<sup>[2]</sup> was taking a pillow battle on the bed. But you, were examining every leg and joint of the bed. I didn't know why you did that at first, and didn't notice all your actions by the bed … But later, when they were playing cockily, you stood in front of SYH, with a smile. That's a strange smile, it felt like a smiling tiger<sup>[3]</sup>. Your hands were hiding behind your back, with something gripping in. SYH thought you was going to do something to him, stopped waving the pillow and looked at you. You stretched out your hand from the back. I forget it's the left or the right hand. You opened your hand and showed a thick screw of about 10 cm in length and 1 cm in width. SYH and<sup>[4]</sup> all the others paused, then froze with stunned eyes! Good gracious! The screw in the bed was demounted … But you are on the lower bunk, SYH is on the bunk above you, and the screw is from your bed! If the bed collapses one day, the person gets hurt is you! What a <span style="border:1px solid; border-radius:50%; display:inline-block;">fool</span>! *Gege*<sup>[5]</sup> is so worried about you … baby CY.

The last two weighty big big big boss!!! SYH, FXR! You are insane. On that day, CY got something in powder for drying hair. It's something to sprinkle on the head, to make the hair not be so greasy. There are two bottles, but FXR take one away for himself. FXR, isn't your conscience aching? Why snatch what CY should use to control the grease! You sprinkled on your hair, it turned whiter, like grandma's grey. You felt you are smart, and looked into the mirror for a long time, with your iconic expression and “slanted eyebrows”. At this time, SYH came from the wash room and saw this. He asked, what's wrong with your hair, in an emotional tone. Then, FXR held what he snatched from CY and sprinkled a lot on SYH's hair! I thought SYH would be averse to it! But you … became insane and looked at the figure in the mirror: “Wow! Too handsome! LIN Mo, look! So handsome! Wow! Gracious!” My voice in mind: “This guy, is not SYH. No! Never!” FXR saw your reaction, also turned insane and yell: “Haha, it's true!” I can say nothing at all. Just sprinkled flour on the hair, how can it be so exciting? These days, <span style="border:1px solid; border-radius:50%; display:inline-block;">girl's romance</span> is wandering in their minds …

But I know you are diligent in training. All the weird actions must be caused by fatigue. Perhaps I am the only normal person left in the Music Club! Ai … How lamented!

Note:
1. *Lene* is a suffix used at the end of the sentence in Chinese, but there is no way to show it in English. Hence, the suffix is kept in status quo.
2. The original text used “and”s in English.
3. “A smiling tiger” means a villain smiling as if s/he is kind for you.
4. The original text used “and” in English.
5. Here, “gege” (elder brother) indicates LIN Mo himself.
