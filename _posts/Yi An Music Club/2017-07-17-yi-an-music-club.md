LIN Mo's diary  
LIN Mo says the weather is: Dunno!  
LIN Mo says the date is: 17th, July, xxxx

Today, I'll skip everything in the morning, since the major show didn't occur. This show is a “battle” between CHI Yi and HE Luo-luo.

Now there are two bonfires in the ring. The black fire is no doubt CHI Yi, while the grey one is no doubt HE Luo-luo.

What happened before this? The both sides were quite harmonious, pure-minded, kind-hearted! This was a peaceful scene. However! At that time, I blurted out: “HE Luo-luo, the Golden Lion King<sup>[1]</sup>.” (Note: Recently, Luo-luo's hair is as dry as been held by ten bottled of hairspray. So he got the nickname of “the Golden Lion King”!) Then, HE Luo-luo thought the voice was from CHI Yi! Excuse me! Is my voice similar to CHI Yir's<sup>[2]</sup>? But this was not the point. At this time, HE Luo-luo said:  
“Who's the ‘Golden Lion King’?”  
“I didn't say that. Maybe that's LIN Mo, or you got a hallucination.”  
“Yoho?!” HE Luo-luo raised his tone, “it must be you. LIN Mo is reading a book!”  
“I didn't.” CHI Yi looked at me and forced a smile, “look, LIN Mo is smiling. Look! Look! Look!”  
But HE Luo-luo didn't care about his words at all: “You black skin!”  
“Who's black skin!” CHI Yi stroke back.

It seemed the battle was about to start.

The soprano HE Luo-luo yelled: “Aha! On guard!” HE Luo-luo hooked CHI Yi and pressed him under his body. But CHI Yi didn't yield, reached out a hand and scratched HE Luo-luo's waist! HE Luo-luo was stimulated and his body made a bounce. The grey fire and the black fire were raging fiercer!

CHI Yi's face was squeezed on the sofa, he was in inferiority. But HE Luo-luo cannot do anything further on CHI Yi. Once he attacked, CHI Yi would strike back with instinct. The strength was so large that HE Luo-luo was shouting “aaah”.

At this moment, <span style="border:1px solid; border-radius:50%; width:24px; display:inline-block;">I</span> – held the breath and fix the attention, gathered *qi* to *dantian*<sup>[3]</sup>, with clear *qi* ascending and turbid *qi* descending, both *qi* poured into the soles of the feet, dashed to them and stopped the “pupils” battle. After all, I'm always a upright, brave, and kind person!

I hope the pupils could lessen their fights, to free me from the worry. Right, the pupils are  
HE Luo-luo (the Golden Lion King)  
CHI Yi (the black skin)

Bye. Too many words, pardon me!

Note:
1. “Golden Lion King” (金毛狮王) is the nickname of XIE Xun (谢逊), who is a character in the novel *The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber* (倚天屠龍記), written by JIN Yong (金庸).
2. “CHI Yir”, in *erhua* (儿化), is from the radio show *Yi An Good Night* (易安说晚安) Episode 1.
3. *Qi* (气), a vital force forming part of a being. *Dantian* (丹田), the focal points for meditative and exercise techniques.
