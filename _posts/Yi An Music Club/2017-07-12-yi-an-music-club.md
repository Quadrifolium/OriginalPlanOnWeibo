Yi-hang's diary

Now I'm writing the diary. Actually, I got back to the agency only several hours ago, because I was taking a drip in hospital for a long time, and even fell asleep. When woke up, I felt quite hungry, it's time to have some food! After gobbling, I stepped on the road back … Well, the summer in Shanghai is really hot. When I was bored and started to count “one SUN Yi-hang, two SUN Yi-hang”, the bus finally arrived! Thank Heaven, thank Earth, I love you!

Mm … Unluckily, I ran across the members taking the dance lesson. I stared at them, and they stared at me. Awkward. Then, the teacher broke the silence: “Do you have ‘free style’?” I: “???”

All right … Then, I saw them dancing in franzy. LIN Mo … Skip him. HE Luo-luo was like a gorilla trying to attack someone., ZHAN Yi-wen was indulging in self-delusion. CHI Yi … There's no such a person. FANG Xiang-rui was wiggling like being drunk in milk!

Gracious! So horrible. And I ran away.
