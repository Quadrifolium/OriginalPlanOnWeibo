27th　　Thursday  
Diary  
HE Luo-luo  
Weather: Bright sunny day …　　Mood: Good<sup>[1]</sup>

“Come on, show the movements through.”

When we were dancing, Alumnus Huang came in to take photos. FANG XR was sitting in a chair and talked to him: “Huang'er<sup>[2]</sup>, take some photos of mine.” When FANG XR made a PS<sup>[3]</sup>, Lao Huang<sup>[4]</sup> said: “I won't take yours, I've already taken too many of yours.”  
“Why?” → F  
“It should be efficient.” → H  
“Come on, LIN Mo. I haven't taken yours.” → H  
And FANG XR went to read his book.

SUN YH has indulged in and can't move from grandma's grey, haha!!!  
“FANG XR, grandma's grey on me.”  
“With grandma's grey, the singing becomes more pleasing *lene*<sup>[5]</sup>!”

And about LIN Mo, don't blame me as you mocked me yesterday!! Hihi.

Last night, he didn't sleep on time but was singing to me. The noise woke me up, and I found a head was close to my face. I was nearly frightened to death. May I ask how did you get to the upper bunk I'm sleeping on?

End 😊

Note:
1. The original text used “good” in English.
2. “Er” (儿) is originally used after one's given name, when this person is an intimate family member in the same or a younger generation. This is not a common usage in everyday life.
3. Pose.
4. “Lao” (老) is a prefix used before one's surname, when this person is a male family member or friend in the same generation.
5. See Note [1] in the diary on 2017-07-26.
