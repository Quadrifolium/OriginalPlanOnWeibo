**Notices**

1. The high temperature and hot weather these days are not suitable for outdoor activities. As the weather condition on 19th August cannot be predicted at present, the exhibition outside the gymnasium planned to hold in the afternoon is cancelled, only the booth for sealing student's card and getting exclusive photo sets is reserved. Please leave the place with no shade once you finished sealing or getting your photo sets, to avoid getting heat stroke. The gymnasium sits in the trading centre of Huangpu District, we suggest the attendees arriving early to stay in the markets or malls around.
2. Luwan Gymnasium sits in a trading centre, the roads around are narrow and unsuited to crowd. In order to assure the normal order of the area, the security department demands **no supporting event outside the gymnasium including waving flags**, and the host will prepare fixed booths for groups and organisations. To avoid getting heat stroke, please stay in markets or malls around and wait to enter the gymnasium at the set time.
3. Yi An Middle School hopes to present a festival perfect in visual and sound effect, and performance with all the alumni and parents. Thus, every event hosted by the school **do not allow any luminous board on the site**. We recommend using the remote control supporting stick officially released, to have the colour coordinated with the performance on stage. *We suggest silver stick if you don't have the official one.*
4. *Non-luminous* supporting banners and fans smaller than 50cm × 50cm and do not block the vision are permitted. Here, we emphasize again that **no luminous board is allowed**, and *non-luminous supporting banners and fans are permitted*. Please make allowance for the decision.
5. Every attendee should product the ticket and accept the security check before entering the site. The staff will issue the gift bag in order after the security check. Please don't stay by the checkpoints, but find your seat as soon as possible. To leave the checkpoints clear is also the virtue during watching a performance.
6. Please focus on the stage during the performance. Keep your mobile phone silent, don't tread on the chair, don't cross the separation facilities, don't smoke, don't throw anything, don't use or wave any prohibited supporting stuff. The guards will have worked for a whole day, please don't increase the pressure for them. Once improper behaviour is found, the committed guards have the right to take the person away. Please preserve the order for the performance together.

We are looking forward to present a perfect festival with all the alumni and parents. They may seem lengthy, but please read and abide by the notices carefully. “An Yi Yang De” (安以养德; cultivate virtue via peace and comfortable environment), be a good man.
