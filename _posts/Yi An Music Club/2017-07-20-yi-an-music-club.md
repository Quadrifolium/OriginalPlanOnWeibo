20th July　　Thursday　　Sunny  
Yi-hang's diary 2.0

About the matter of wearing *dudou*<sup>[1]</sup> yesterday, I must explain here. LIN Mo compelled me to do that, that's not of my own accord! What is the most horrible, the assistant told me today, that he took a snap stealthily. Fine, I should restrain myself.

“Oh, by the way, I sent it to Alumnus Huang<sup>[2]</sup>.” “What?” How can I stand it? If I don't work off the grievance, how can Warrior Sun survive in *jianghu*<sup>[3]</sup>?

But just at this time, Huang came from nowhere and made the last hit: “Mm, I saw it, and vomited all the food in stomach.”

Mm, just gloat as you like. I need to cool down by the wall. From now on, there won't be SUN Yi-hang in *jianghu*.

By the way, everyone is striving hard for the summer festival. Crawling back to the dorm, and jogging early in the morning, everyone is great. Even this diary is written in the break time. After all, please wait to enjoy it.

PS: Today, when passed by FANG Xiang-rui, CHI Yi muttered “Giant Face”. I'm very worried about him. Because we don't have mobile phone at hand, no one can call 120<sup>[4]</sup> if he's beaten seriously.

Note:
1. *Dudou* (肚兜), a traditional Chinese form of the bodice.
2. “Alumnus Huang” is the CEO HUANG Rui.
3. *Jianghu* (江湖) means a community of martial artists in wuxia stories.
4. “120” is the emergency telephone number in mainland China.
