Original musical – *Yi An Music Club · 24 Hours in Urgency*  
When the reality is striking the dream, will you brave forward or shrink back?

In the time glutted with idols, is the strength or the fortune more important? What hidden stories have happened beneath the attractive appearance?

When many boys gathered together for the same dream, when facing all sorts of attractions and challenges, do they pursue the personal value or guard the colletive honour?

The members of Yi An Music Club tell you their answer.
