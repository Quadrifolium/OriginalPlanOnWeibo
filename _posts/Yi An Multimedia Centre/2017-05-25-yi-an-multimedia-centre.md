Though it's not decent for an official account to idle around, I still like to read your posts. When seeing many people regain the interest of reading, I feel the tiny work is having great meaning. There are also hurting words. But on second thought, it's also caring for the students like me, and I'm relieved. Keep summing up and rethinking in the work, study never ends. Pardon me for the sensible mind after listening to the literature.
