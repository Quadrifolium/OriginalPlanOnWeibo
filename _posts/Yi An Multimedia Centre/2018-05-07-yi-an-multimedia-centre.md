Cloudy. The long-missing Speech Under the National Flag was held by Class 2 Senior Grade 2, with the topic of “Treasure the dream”. Dream is like a seed planted in the heart. Only irrigating with efforts can it sprout and grow. It may be weak or even fragile at first. But the tiny green is embellishing soul for being outstanding. We hope Yi An students be confident for approaching the dream.
