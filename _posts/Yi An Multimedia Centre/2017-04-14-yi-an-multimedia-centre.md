Still have some time. What about telling me your understanding of “The more one says, the deeper s/he gets into trouble. It is better to keep silent and keep the words in the mind.” The most thoughtful “Writing Star” before 11 o'clock will have the chance to get my answer of a question in private message … For those who copy and paste – ![bye](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/70/88_org.gif)

*Words on image:*  
The more one says, the deeper s/he gets into trouble. It is better to keep silent and keep the words in the mind.  
(This is an excerpt from *Tao Te Ching* (道德经))

Note:
1. “hr” is probably the abbreviation of the name of the CEO – HUANG Rui.
