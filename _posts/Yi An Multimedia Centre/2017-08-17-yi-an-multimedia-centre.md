Well, I'm alive. ![bitter joy](http://img.t.sinajs.cn/t4/appstyle/expression/ext/normal/2c/moren_yunbei_org.png)×3 It's during the rehearsal that I suddenly realised that I haven't post about the *Reading Session* … Such memory is just like what [@YiAnMusicClub-FangXiangRui](http://weibo.com/u/6117583008) said, “living tenaciously”. :sweat:×3 The bonus has certainly gone, but the attitude should be right! An exposure for you: “20” is not only [@YiAnMusicClub-FangXiangRui](http://weibo.com/u/6117583008)'s lucky number, it's also the first two digits of the lock screen password of his mobile. :satisfied:×3 [❏ Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPFGQwpK-e4)

Note:
1. In the special programme of *Yi An Good Night*, FANG Xiang-rui stated his lucky number.
