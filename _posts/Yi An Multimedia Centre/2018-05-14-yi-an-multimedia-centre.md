Cloudy. The Speech Under the National Flag was held by Class 3 Senior Grade 2 with the topic “Noble soul”. Men are mostly idealistic when being young, and turning realistic with the increase of the age. In our lives, it is impossible to deny the importance of being flexible, but the principles be maintained at the same time. It is the soul in the inner world that tells nobility and mediocrity apart. We wish everyone of you hold the virtuous soul on the road of life.
