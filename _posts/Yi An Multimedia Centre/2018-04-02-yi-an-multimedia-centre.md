Cloudy. The Speech Under the National Flag was held by Class 5 Senior Grade 1 with the topic of “Qingming”. The holiday for *Qingming* is getting near. This is not only the time for memorising the departed, but also the bond which connects all the Chinese people through the common ancestor. Besides visiting graves, there are activities like taking an outing, planting willows, and traditional amusements such as flying kites and having *qingtuan*. We wish everyone has a relaxed and healthy vacation.
