Cloudy. After one-week latency, today's Speech Under the National Flag was held by Class 7 Senior Grade 1, with the topic of “Be Aspirational”. There's a saying that “diligence makes one's lifetime doubled, showing talent all-out is like soaring thousands of miles”. How diligent we are, how long we persist, will mark the depth of the track of our lives. Everyone is undertaking high expectations from the family and the teachers, which is a heavy responsibility. Every student should make a decision in the mind and be persistent on it. In this way, great achievement will finally come to you.

Note:
1. The saying comes from a poem written by MAO Ze-dong (毛泽东; 1893 – 1976).
