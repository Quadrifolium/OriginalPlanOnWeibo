Cloudy. The Speech Under the National Flag was held by Class 4 Senior Grade 2 with the topic of “Hold fast to hope”. The textbook told us that “for a blooming flower, people only marvel at the brilliance it is showing. But its sprout had been soaked in tears, had shed great sacrifice”. After seeding the hope, we should think over the road for the future. After the direction's determined, we should move ahead with firm and steady steps, stick to the faith even in gales and storms, be the model of oneself.
