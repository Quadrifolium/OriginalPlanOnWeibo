Flag-raising! It's a sunny day. The ceremony was held by Class 1 Senior Grade 1, with the topic of “Responsibilities”. Everyone is in different roles in the class and in the school, with different responsibilities on the bodies. Besides learning, every student should also be a model for those in lower grades, which is one of the responsibilities. The life is not only with longings and dreams, responsibilities are also in our youth.  
And a notice from the Education Office: The student without the ID card should get his from the office ASAP.
