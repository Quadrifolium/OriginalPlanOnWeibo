Cloudy. The Speech Under the National Flag was held by Class 4 Senior Grade 1 with the topic of “Discipline”. Despite how well we do in study or other aspects, without the guide of discipline, one is like a kite separated from the string, will fall down sooner or later. Nothing can be accomplished without norms. Please be strict with yourselves and follow the discipline, for the more civilised class, and the more harmonious campus.
