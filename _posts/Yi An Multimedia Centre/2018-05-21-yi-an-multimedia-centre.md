Overcast to light rain. The flag-raising cancelled, and the Speech Under the National Flag was held via Yi An Radio by Class 4 Senior Grade 2, with the topic of “Sprint for *Gaokao*”. In less than a month, we will see Yi An students in Senior Grade 3 off. And due to the intense preparation, many of them cannot join the Music Club's party. But they are also struggling hard on their own way. After wind and rain, we will meet again. Fighting, Yi An!
